6/12/17, 4:19 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Just now saw your message. We should have. Lil c didn't have her blanket for nap.
6/12/17, 4:19 PM - Hannah Guedenet: You headed home?
6/12/17, 4:23 PM - Charles G: Yeah. Going to be a little late though. Ran into someone I hadn't seen in awhile. Just got to bus station
6/12/17, 4:24 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Ok
6/12/17, 4:24 PM - Hannah Guedenet: See you soon
6/12/17, 4:34 PM - Charles G: On the 25 bus
6/12/17, 4:35 PM - Hannah Guedenet: K
6/13/17, 6:55 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Ms Fanny was really sad when I told her we aren't staying. I feel bad but I also do not want to continue supporting anything Ms Lois does. The teachers need to find other jobs. I just don't trust that Ms Lois cares at all about them.
6/13/17, 7:16 AM - Charles G: I agree. It feels like a toxic environment over there
6/13/17, 3:15 PM - Charles G: I assume we're still having the Duncan's over?
6/13/17, 3:18 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Damn. Forgot to cancel. It's too late now. Might just kick them out early. I'm leaving in a few
6/13/17, 3:20 PM - Charles G: Ok
6/13/17, 3:20 PM - Charles G: What time are they coming?
6/13/17, 3:22 PM - Hannah Guedenet: 7ish
6/13/17, 3:23 PM - Charles G: Ok
6/13/17, 3:32 PM - Charles G: So I took the bus home again. You can drive home now
6/13/17, 3:32 PM - Charles G: Going to pick up girls in stroller
6/13/17, 3:32 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Oh babe
6/13/17, 3:32 PM - Hannah Guedenet: I can pick y'all up. It's so hog
6/13/17, 3:32 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Hot
6/13/17, 3:35 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Waiting at union station for a train
6/13/17, 3:36 PM - Charles G: Ok
6/13/17, 3:41 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Still waiting
6/13/17, 3:41 PM - Hannah Guedenet: I forgot. The temp gets above 90 and the red line stops working.
6/13/17, 3:42 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Absolutely no indications when a train will arrive...
6/13/17, 3:43 PM - Charles G: Ok. That sucks. We'll, I'll take them to the park while we wait
6/13/17, 3:43 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Ok. Or just walk home at this point. It's too hot to stay outside for very long.
6/13/17, 3:49 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Finally on a train but now stopped at noma. Absolutely no announcement from conductor on the cause of the delay
6/13/17, 3:50 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Looking on Twitter and looks like major issue at silver spring. Not sure when I'm getting home...
6/13/17, 3:52 PM - Charles G: I didn't bring stroller
6/13/17, 3:52 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Well....
6/13/17, 3:52 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Not sure what to tell you. Hmmm
6/13/17, 3:55 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Girls really need baths before dinner so we don't have to do that while Duncan's are there
6/13/17, 4:01 PM - Charles G: Ok. We'll be waiting at the park. Definitely not waking without stroller
6/13/17, 4:01 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Ok. Im at fort Totten. Probably another 20 mins at least.
6/13/17, 4:04 PM - Charles G: Ok
6/13/17, 4:04 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Sitting outside Takoma station. I can see our car.
6/13/17, 4:12 PM - Charles G: Cool. We're at the steak, near park at the school
6/13/17, 4:13 PM - Charles G: Stream
6/13/17, 4:15 PM - Hannah Guedenet: In the car
6/15/17, 4:05 PM - Hannah Guedenet: You headed home? I'm so tired and still don't feel great.
6/15/17, 4:07 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Oh and just a heads up that all the teachers except Ms Fanny are leaving.
6/15/17, 4:08 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Tomorrow is their last day
6/15/17, 4:23 PM - Charles G: I'm waiting for a bus still
6/15/17, 4:23 PM - Hannah Guedenet: You really need to get bike share
6/15/17, 4:23 PM - Charles G: All the teachers except Fanny are leaving?? Holy smokes!
6/15/17, 4:24 PM - Charles G: Ms Fanny was the only teacher at oew this morning at drop off. It was her and Ms. Lois
6/15/17, 4:25 PM - Hannah Guedenet: I'm so ready to be done
6/15/17, 4:25 PM - Charles G: That place is toxic
6/15/17, 4:25 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Glad it's only one more day. Girls and I are laying in our bed. I feel like poop
6/15/17, 4:25 PM - Charles G: I mean the environment, not the teachers
6/15/17, 4:26 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Agreed.
6/15/17, 4:27 PM - Charles G: The school will close down if it's just just Fanny...
6/15/17, 4:28 PM - Charles G: On the 16
6/15/17, 4:33 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Ok see you soon. You might have to do dinner
6/15/17, 4:37 PM - Charles G: Ok. That's fine
6/16/17, 5:56 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Headed home. Be home soon
6/16/17, 6:02 AM - Charles G: Ok
6/16/17, 11:00 AM - Hannah Guedenet: No sign of our Airbnb guests. Which I find annoying since I worked hard to get the place ready in time. Hope the retreat is going well.
6/16/17, 11:04 AM - Charles G: That's weird. Sorry babe
6/16/17, 11:53 AM - Hannah Guedenet: They arrived. Had a flat tire. They are SO young!! And they're here for comicon. They have costumes with fake guns and swords.
6/16/17, 1:04 PM - Charles G: How funny. 😊
6/16/17, 2:10 PM - Hannah Guedenet: I sent the pic via text. So awesome!
6/16/17, 2:54 PM - Hannah Guedenet: What's up with you??
6/16/17, 2:54 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Also you wanna watch guardians of the Galaxy tonight?
6/16/17, 3:09 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Hello?
6/16/17, 3:10 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Going to get the girls soon. Are we picking you up?
6/16/17, 3:42 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Are you alive???
6/18/17, 2:20 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Hey babe so I may have to cancel on our neighbors. I'm feeling like crap. I don't know what's wrong with me. You ok with ths
6/18/17, 2:20 PM - Hannah Guedenet: That?
6/18/17, 2:35 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Sorry went ahead and cancelled. Don't know what's wrong with me.
6/18/17, 2:41 PM - Charles G: <Media omitted>

6/19/17, 4:11 PM - Charles G: I'm on the 25

6/22/17, 7:05 AM - Hannah Guedenet: We also got an Airbnb request but it would mean flipping the place by myself on a Thursday. Wondering if I just say no
6/22/17, 7:20 AM - Hannah Guedenet: I'm checking with the guest who is checking in on Thursday to see what time they except to arrive. But I have to go to the office that day so not sure i Can accept. Should have blocked off that day

6/27/17, 1:33 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Samiha got the job at AV!
6/27/17, 2:49 PM - Charles G: Yay! Glad it's official.
6/27/17, 2:49 PM - Charles G: Thanks for the video. It made me miss you guys even more.
6/27/17, 2:49 PM - Hannah Guedenet: She called me earlier because she wasn't sure if she would make them mad if she tried to negotiate the salary...
6/27/17, 2:50 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Really?? You've missed us?? Sounds like you're having too much fun to miss us...
6/27/17, 2:50 PM - Charles G: Ha! I can have fun and miss you too! They're not exclusive
6/27/17, 2:52 PM - Charles G: I treated Melanie to a nice dinner tonight. There's a speak easy behind the restaurant but turns out it was undergoing renovation. Real bummer
6/27/17, 2:53 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Oh that stinks. But glad you treated her.
6/27/17, 2:53 PM - Charles G: The walk along the Rhone and swimming in the Rhone was really nice though. Good sister brother time
6/27/17, 2:53 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Omg I have worked in the office today with the two screens. Revolutionary!!! Never going to the office ever again!
6/27/17, 2:53 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Sounds lovely babe. Glad you had that time!
6/27/17, 2:53 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Run out of things to talk about? 😉

6/27/17, 3:22 PM - Charles G: Well that's good. I'll send another tomorrow
6/28/17, 6:42 AM - Hannah Guedenet: <Media omitted>
6/28/17, 8:17 AM - Charles G: Yay!!
6/28/17, 8:19 AM - Charles G: Miss you guys. UN meeting today was such a waste of time. Maybe tomorrow will be better. Plus, got fined 140 francs because I didn't have a bus ticket.
6/28/17, 8:23 AM - Charles G: I didn't have a credit card and the machines only accept coins. I was running really late so I hopped on anyways. Just my luck that two stops later, police get on board
6/28/17, 8:23 AM - Charles G: I was so pissed/upset
6/28/17, 8:26 AM - Charles G: Maybe IREX will reimburse it as a travel expenses
6/28/17, 8:49 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Oh no babe!!
6/28/17, 8:52 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Man they mean business
6/28/17, 8:52 AM - Hannah Guedenet: That's is not cheap
6/28/17, 8:53 AM - Hannah Guedenet: We are almost at Dutch wonderland. Stuck in traffic
6/28/17, 8:53 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Really hope IREX will pay you back

8/5/17, 5:59 PM - Charles G: I'm good on food. Not that hungry
8/5/17, 5:59 PM - Hannah Guedenet: We always end up spending too much money here and leaving hungry
8/5/17, 5:59 PM - Hannah Guedenet: I'm still hungry...
8/5/17, 6:01 PM - Hannah Guedenet: And they're now comparing fake IDs

8/21/17, 3:55 PM - Charles G: Will you put a couple more of our Michigan beers in the fridge or freezer?
8/21/17, 4:11 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Which ones??
8/21/17, 4:11 PM - Hannah Guedenet: I'm a bit stressed
8/21/17, 4:13 PM - Charles G: Why stressed?

8/21/17, 4:15 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Ok
8/21/17, 4:15 PM - Hannah Guedenet: What beers should I take?
8/21/17, 4:16 PM - Charles G: Pick whatever beers. We could come over with four different ones and do a tasting
8/21/17, 4:17 PM - Charles G: Add a Rapunzel and a scallywag?
8/21/17, 4:18 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Ok
8/21/17, 4:18 PM - Hannah Guedenet: See my text about stress. Also Addie is whining and c is tired and moody
8/21/17, 4:18 PM - Charles G: Yikes, tough visit to the chickens. 😮
8/21/17, 4:19 PM - Hannah Guedenet: To put it lightly
8/21/17, 4:19 PM - Charles G: I'm really sorry.
8/21/17, 4:19 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Ok I guess I'll go over. Not feeling super social
8/21/17, 4:34 PM - Charles G: Ok. Next stop is mine
8/22/17, 3:49 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Don't forget bike is by entrance
8/22/17, 3:49 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Also stand is still there
8/22/17, 3:49 PM - Hannah Guedenet: I took out Charlotte's car seat and folded down the back seat. It might fit...
8/22/17, 4:26 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Where are you?
8/22/17, 4:30 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Hello??
8/23/17, 5:16 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Arrived at the airport. I love flying out of BWI
8/23/17, 5:16 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Give the girls kisses from me
8/23/17, 6:00 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Omg there's a family next to me and the mom is just barking at her kids and one is totally freaking out. I just want her to take a breath and talk to her kids. She also just told one of them he's not going on the plane. Sorry I shouldn't judge people's parenting but I feel bad for the kids.
8/23/17, 6:00 AM - Hannah Guedenet: She is also shoving food in her kids faces...
8/23/17, 6:01 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Oh and there is now a chick fil a and flying dog tap room at BWI! We need to fly more often.
8/23/17, 6:15 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Ok now I hear Matthews voice in my head from Sunday. I don't know her story and it's not my business.
8/23/17, 6:28 AM - Hannah Guedenet: On the plane. Love you!
8/23/17, 6:38 AM - Hannah Guedenet: I'm seated next to an older couple that remind me of my parents. I had to help them connect to WiFi
8/23/17, 6:39 AM - Hannah Guedenet: They have all their passwords on sticky notes on their iPad cover!
8/23/17, 6:39 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Sorry...I'll stop now. I miss you. Enjoy my random musings and have a fabulous day babe!!
8/23/17, 6:54 AM - Charles G: You are quite the people watcher ☺️
8/23/17, 6:54 AM - Charles G: 🙂
8/23/17, 6:55 AM - Charles G: I had a hard time getting girls up. Charlotte takes forever picking out clothes. I may start having her pick them the night before. There are at least two perfectly fine shirts/skirts that she never wants to wear.
8/23/17, 12:08 PM - Hannah Guedenet: She had already picked out her shorts and had her swimsuit on top!!
8/23/17, 12:09 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Sorry she was a pain
8/23/17, 12:09 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Just landed
8/23/17, 12:55 PM - Hannah Guedenet: On my way to Airbnb saw a sign for legal weed. Had forgotten about that!
8/24/17, 6:40 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Morning babe. Guess you'll get this when you get into the office. I didn't sleep great but I should be ok today. I'm kicking myself because I forgot to bring the bars that I bought!! Also I can hear lots of walking around upstairs and there were some strange ponding noises until the middle of the night. So I guess I shouldn't worry too much about noise at our place. They are even up at 5:30 walking all around. I definitely don't miss this part of living in an apartment.
8/24/17, 7:28 AM - Charles G: Sorry you didn't sleep well, especially with a big day ahead of you. I rescheduled the data party so I feel much better and a lot less anxious than I had been
8/24/17, 7:29 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Oh good
8/24/17, 7:29 AM - Hannah Guedenet: How'd the morning go??
8/24/17, 7:34 AM - Hannah Guedenet: I think I just figured out the pounding noise. It's trucks on the nearby freeway
8/24/17, 7:34 AM - Hannah Guedenet: I was hoping to go for a run but I have a lot still to dk
8/24/17, 7:34 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Do
8/24/17, 7:37 AM - Charles G: Morning went alright. Addie had a hard time getting out of bed again. I think I'll shoot for an early bedtime tonight.
8/24/17, 7:37 AM - Charles G: Good luck today! You are going to rock!
8/24/17, 7:40 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Thanks babe. And thank you for your never ending support of my job and of me. I love you so much
8/24/17, 7:41 AM - Charles G: Love you too!
8/24/17, 8:33 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Remember how there were no homeless people in Geneva. They're all in Seattle!
8/24/17, 8:33 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Apparently they also have a really bad heroin problem here
8/24/17, 1:32 PM - Charles G: Really? I would not have thought that.
8/24/17, 6:32 PM - Hannah Guedenet: I really want to bring back some special mints...
8/24/17, 6:32 PM - Hannah Guedenet: No clear where to buy them though
8/24/17, 6:33 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Waiting for Scott and I'm exhausted.
8/24/17, 6:34 PM - Charles G: Is Seattle known for its mints?
8/24/17, 9:26 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Pot, babe
8/24/17, 11:12 PM - Hannah Guedenet: What a long day. I'm so tired of talking. It was good to see Scott and Molly
8/24/17, 11:20 PM - Hannah Guedenet: The girls are adorable
8/24/17, 11:20 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Going to bed. Love you
8/25/17, 7:08 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Morning babe. Hope you're doing ok. Love you
8/25/17, 9:26 AM - Hannah Guedenet: At the airport. Can you get pizza for dinner? And also pita chips and hummus?
8/25/17, 9:27 AM - Hannah Guedenet: To take to the cabin
8/25/17, 9:51 AM - Charles G: Morning!
8/25/17, 9:51 AM - Charles G: Yep. I'll go to Aldi later
8/25/17, 9:54 AM - Hannah Guedenet: On the plane. See you in about 6 hours. Love you
8/25/17, 9:54 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Thanks babe.
8/25/17, 9:54 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Girls ok this AM?
8/25/17, 9:55 AM - Hannah Guedenet: And I saw a photo from HiMama where Addie just has random bows in her hair. Do you just let her put whatever she wants in her hair?? 😄
8/25/17, 9:58 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Were you able to find out about moving the water heater?
8/25/17, 12:21 PM - Charles G: Addie went let me put rubber bands in her hair anymore. And they're not random. They always match something...
8/25/17, 2:49 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Landed
8/25/17, 2:49 PM - Hannah Guedenet: I think they're ability to match might be open to interpretation
8/25/17, 2:50 PM - Charles G: Yay! You're almost home!
8/25/17, 3:09 PM - Hannah Guedenet: In the taxi
8/25/17, 3:33 PM - Charles G: I'm getting the girls. Door is open

8/28/17, 7:06 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Ok will make a note
8/28/17, 7:06 AM - Hannah Guedenet: You feeling ok?
8/28/17, 7:06 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Was anything different at Addie's school?
8/28/17, 7:12 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Hey can you put the Southwest credit card in your wallet and start using it for everything??
8/28/17, 3:07 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Babe...you left the front door completely wide open!!!
8/28/17, 3:55 PM - Charles G: Oh my goodness. I am such a knuckle head. Can't believe I left it open
8/28/17, 3:55 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Yeah it's just freaky when I pull up
8/28/17, 3:56 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Where are you?
8/28/17, 4:12 PM - Charles G: Getting on bike
8/29/17, 2:47 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Hey did you get a hold of Matt??
8/29/17, 3:54 PM - Charles G: I called earlier and left a message
8/29/17, 3:54 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Goodness he really doesn't want our business. What's plan b?
8/29/17, 3:54 PM - Hannah Guedenet: When you leaving office?
8/29/17, 3:54 PM - Charles G: Maybe he's sick or something?
8/29/17, 3:55 PM - Charles G: Already left. I couldn't concentrate anymore. I'm on the metro.
8/29/17, 3:56 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Maybe
8/29/17, 4:00 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Ok. Well save me a spot
8/29/17, 4:40 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Where are you?
8/29/17, 4:46 PM - Charles G: At the school. Where r u?

8/30/17, 3:40 PM - Hannah Guedenet: The one down the hill from the gazebo
8/31/17, 4:32 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Occasionally taking the bus helps remind me that biking is better even if does take more physical effort. Just missed the 16 but luckily caught a k9. But the driver is super slow and has the heat on
8/31/17, 4:48 AM - Charles G: Yeah, I need to bike to metro next week
8/31/17, 4:48 AM - Hannah Guedenet: ??
8/31/17, 4:50 AM - Charles G: ??
8/31/17, 4:51 AM - Charles G: I agree. Biking is better. I want to bike more for my commute
8/31/17, 4:51 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Ok got it. You can't bike. You have to take Addie to school...I think that's the plan at least?
8/31/17, 4:53 AM - Charles G: Oh yeah. I need the plan written down
8/31/17, 5:58 AM - Hannah Guedenet: So I am leaning more toward sticking with SELEVER and letting someone else take over WENTA.
8/31/17, 5:58 AM - Hannah Guedenet: I love the project and the staff. And it's still great experience. We should talk this weekend.
8/31/17, 11:09 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Hey I shut down my computer before I read your repsonse about meeting at union. What are you thinking?

10/14/17, 1:43 PM - Hannah Guedenet: **sex
10/14/17, 1:43 PM - Charles G: It really has been. We packed in a lot but I never felt pressure to fit everything in
10/14/17, 1:43 PM - Hannah Guedenet: **have had sex
10/14/17, 1:44 PM - Hannah Guedenet: I'd go on another trip with you...
10/14/17, 1:44 PM - Charles G: Hahaha. I was about to say that I was feeling horny too
10/14/17, 1:44 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Oh man. Missed opportunity!! Damn us!
10/14/17, 1:45 PM - Charles G: Yeah. We should have just done right there in the kitchen. Damn
10/14/17, 1:45 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Hmmm...I like that thought
10/14/17, 1:48 PM - Charles G: We really need to get a better kitchen table
10/14/17, 1:51 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Haha!! Well now I know what will motivate you to get us a new one!!
10/14/17, 1:51 PM - Hannah Guedenet: I'm drunk and sleepy
10/14/17, 1:52 PM - Hannah Guedenet: I keep thinking -- how do we take the wonderful parts of this trip and make them a bigger part of our daily lives...
10/14/17, 1:52 PM - Hannah Guedenet: icwill keep thinking on it.
10/14/17, 1:52 PM - Hannah Guedenet: I
10/14/17, 2:03 PM - Charles G: Passing through a neighborhood of black and indigenous looking people
10/14/17, 2:05 PM - Charles G: Yes, good idea...but how? Something to think about
10/14/17, 2:06 PM - Charles G: In Flores neighborhood, where pope Francis is from
10/14/17, 2:07 PM - Hannah Guedenet: That's where they are all hiding!!
10/14/17, 2:09 PM - Charles G: Yep
10/14/17, 2:33 PM - Charles G: I'm wishing I had priority status. The line is really long
10/14/17, 2:38 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Oh bummer
10/14/17, 3:52 PM - Charles G: Hey. Made it through immigration finally. How's your new place?
10/14/17, 3:55 PM - Charles G: Shit shit shit. I don't seem to have the headphones
10/14/17, 4:05 PM - Hannah Guedenet: What?!?!
10/14/17, 4:05 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Did you leave them on the plane?!?!
10/14/17, 4:08 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Sorry immigration took so long.
10/14/17, 4:09 PM - Hannah Guedenet: I'm annoyed about the headphones
10/14/17, 4:10 PM - Charles G: I'm wondering if I left them at the Airbnb. I remember packing them in the plane
10/14/17, 4:10 PM - Charles G: I'm annoyed too. Very annoyed
10/14/17, 4:11 PM - Hannah Guedenet: I can send Jorge a message but I don't know where you would have left them at the Airbnb
10/14/17, 4:16 PM - Charles G: Yes, please message him. Thanks.
10/14/17, 4:20 PM - Hannah Guedenet: There's a Freddo around the corner from the hotel.
10/14/17, 4:24 PM - Charles G: Lucky you! I got some Havana alfajores at the airport
10/14/17, 4:25 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Of course you did
10/14/17, 4:29 PM - Charles G: I could have gotten a box of 18 but settled on just 4
10/14/17, 4:30 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Ha
10/14/17, 4:30 PM - Hannah Guedenet: You on the plane?
10/14/17, 4:52 PM - Charles G: Yep. Sorry, just seeing your message. Internet is spotty
10/14/17, 4:52 PM - Charles G: What u doing for dinner?
10/14/17, 5:17 PM - Charles G: Getting ready to take off. Love you!!
10/14/17, 6:38 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Had pizza with Ladd. Have a safe flight. Love you!
10/14/17, 7:05 PM - Hannah Guedenet: It was an interesting dinner. Ladd is really unhappy with Charlotte and her poor quality of work. Apparently there are multiple people at AV who won't work with her on projects because she does awful work. And Ladd is frustrated that she's so swamped because she's doing everything.
10/14/17, 7:05 PM - Hannah Guedenet: I just know from Charlotte's point of view that working for Ladd is a nightmare.
10/14/17, 7:06 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Ladd also takes credit for all the Gates money we get which I find annoying. She's just a rather unpleasant person. It's going to be a long week
10/15/17, 4:10 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Well I'm up. Shouldn't complain much to you but I was still up at 1 am. The hotel sucks. There is no air flow so my room was a sauna. Finally room half an ambien. Hope you got some sleep
10/15/17, 4:54 AM - Charles G: Hey. How crappy that you ended up with a lousy hotel room! Well, I didn't get any sleep either. My back was killing me the time
10/15/17, 4:55 AM - Charles G: I'm in Atlanta now, waiting for my next flight
10/15/17, 4:56 AM - Charles G: I did see the big sick movie...highly recommend it. I wish we'd watched it together actually. It's a good date movie
10/15/17, 5:00 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Sorry babe about your back!
10/15/17, 5:00 AM - Hannah Guedenet: And I'll have to check it out. Or maybe wait and watch it with you when I'm back?
10/15/17, 5:00 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Heading to the conference.
10/15/17, 5:00 AM - Hannah Guedenet: I'm tired
10/15/17, 5:01 AM - Charles G: We can watch together but u can watch in the plane too if u want
10/15/17, 5:02 AM - Charles G: Enjoy your first day of learning and networking
10/15/17, 5:09 AM - Hannah Guedenet: I'll try. I'm hoping to see Bonnie this afternoon!
10/15/17, 5:10 AM - Charles G: Cool. Have fun!
10/15/17, 6:21 AM - Hannah Guedenet: I'm already bored and seem to have lost Jean Marie
10/15/17, 6:22 AM - Hannah Guedenet: He never showed up at my hotel this AM and can't find him at the conference
10/15/17, 6:37 AM - Charles G: Oh no! I hope he's ok
10/15/17, 6:39 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Yeah me too
10/15/17, 6:39 AM - Hannah Guedenet: You're going to be home soon...I'm jealous
10/15/17, 6:41 AM - Charles G: Yeah. Boarding now
10/15/17, 6:41 AM - Charles G: I can't wait to see everyone but dreading tomorrow
10/15/17, 6:44 AM - Hannah Guedenet: I know. I wish I could be there to support you
10/15/17, 6:47 AM - Charles G: Thanks. I'll make it through.
10/15/17, 6:49 AM - Hannah Guedenet: I love you. Safe travels!
10/15/17, 6:55 AM - Charles G: Love you too!!
10/15/17, 6:55 AM - Charles G: Taking off
10/15/17, 8:30 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Ran into Rebekah. She's here with boran and their two kids! Zara is 2.5 and Zach is 7 weeks. Boran wants to get into m&e. Will give him your email address.
10/15/17, 8:43 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Random favor -- can you ask your mom if she gave c that pink sweater that's hanging on the stairs railing?
10/15/17, 8:44 AM - Charles G: Who is Rebekah?
10/15/17, 8:44 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Serisouly?
10/15/17, 8:44 AM - Hannah Guedenet: We actually talked about this...
10/15/17, 8:44 AM - Charles G: Ok. I'll talk to my mom
10/15/17, 8:44 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Never mind
10/15/17, 8:45 AM - Charles G: ?
10/15/17, 8:46 AM - Hannah Guedenet: There is really nothing that frustrates me more than us having a conversation and you not listening/retaining anything.
10/15/17, 8:49 AM - Charles G: Oh yeah, the girl from SA
10/15/17, 8:49 AM - Charles G: That I need with Scott and Molly
10/15/17, 8:49 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Woman. Yes.
10/15/17, 8:49 AM - Charles G: Met, not need
10/15/17, 8:50 AM - Hannah Guedenet: And then we are with her and her fiance in SA too
10/15/17, 8:50 AM - Hannah Guedenet: **ate
10/15/17, 8:51 AM - Charles G: Yes, I remember out convo
10/15/17, 8:51 AM - Charles G: Now
10/15/17, 8:51 AM - Charles G: I haven't slept in over 24 hrs
10/15/17, 8:52 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Sorry babe
10/15/17, 8:52 AM - Charles G: Very  impressive of them to bring their 7 week old
10/15/17, 8:53 AM - Hannah Guedenet: She said he is a super chill baby
10/15/17, 8:53 AM - Hannah Guedenet: They are staying a week after
10/15/17, 8:53 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Staying in Palermo
10/15/17, 9:03 AM - Charles G: How cool! Too bad we didn't time so that we overlapped a little
10/15/17, 9:05 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Yeah. But they're with their kids...
10/15/17, 9:05 AM - Hannah Guedenet: I might offer to babysit one night so they can go out.
10/15/17, 9:06 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Wow you got out fast!
10/15/17, 9:06 AM - Charles G: I bet they would really like that
10/15/17, 9:07 AM - Charles G: Yep. I went through security in Atlanta so I just needed to pickup my bag here and viola
10/15/17, 9:07 AM - Charles G: Voila
10/15/17, 9:07 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Wonder how long you'll have to wait...
10/15/17, 9:08 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Your dad's message didn't suggest that they were that close.
10/15/17, 9:08 AM - Hannah Guedenet: My phone battery is awful! Have hardly any left and was fully charged this am
10/15/17, 9:15 AM - Charles G: Yeah. I'm thinking they thought it would take me longer too
10/15/17, 9:16 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Still waiting? Ugh. I see Bonnie in the session in at. Really hope i get to catch up with her
10/15/17, 9:19 AM - Charles G: They're here!
10/15/17, 9:19 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Give them huge hugs!!! Wish I was there!
10/15/17, 9:31 AM - Charles G: I'm sitting in the middle and they're hugging my arms 😊
10/15/17, 9:33 AM - Charles G: 😍😋🤣😎😎😎🤗🤧👻😤😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘🍇🍇🍉🍑🍒🍓🥔🍒🍓🍒🥝
10/15/17, 9:33 AM - Charles G: From the girls
10/15/17, 9:44 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Ahhh!! Picture!!!!
10/15/17, 9:52 AM - Charles G: <Media omitted>
10/15/17, 9:54 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Love!!! 😍😍😘😘😍😍
10/15/17, 11:29 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Man I wish I was there and not here... I'm tired and we just started
10/15/17, 11:41 AM - Hannah Guedenet: I really think walking as much as we did reduces my appetite. I have been so hungry today because I'm just sitting around and thinking about it.
10/15/17, 11:42 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Also everything is closed on Sunday! It was very hard to find something to eat.
10/15/17, 12:05 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Mourad is here!!
10/15/17, 12:09 PM - Charles G: You already knew he would be there, right? You guys gonna hang out?
10/15/17, 12:10 PM - Charles G: It's warm and humid here
10/15/17, 12:10 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Yeah I did but he's sitting right in front of me. Fun to see him.
10/15/17, 12:10 PM - Charles G: And the house is a mess
10/15/17, 12:10 PM - Hannah Guedenet: The current presenter is awful. She keeps trying to make jokes and they're not funny.
10/15/17, 12:11 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Oh babe...I'm sorry. Make the girls help clean up. And your parents too! You have to be exhausted. Hope it's not too stressful. Though I'm sure it is.
10/15/17, 12:18 PM - Hannah Guedenet: And one more comment...there is one of the panelists who has this ridiculous smirk constantly on her face. It is cracking me up! It's like an extreme of resting bitch face -- weird smirking face like she has an inside joke going on in her head.
10/15/17, 12:58 PM - Charles G: Worse than the Hamilton resting face?
10/15/17, 12:58 PM - Hannah Guedenet: ??
10/15/17, 12:59 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Ohhh.... Hamilton kids!
10/15/17, 12:59 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Got it. Hahaha
10/15/17, 1:00 PM - Charles G: Yeah. Not very nice, I know
10/15/17, 1:19 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Did you see my note about paying Ana? $120
10/15/17, 1:20 PM - Hannah Guedenet: But you'll need cash...
10/15/17, 1:20 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Unless the checks arrived
10/15/17, 1:21 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Nestle has a coffee station in the exhibit hall. And general Mills is giving out bowls of cereal and samples of granola bars
10/15/17, 1:32 PM - Charles G: Wow. Fancy.
10/15/17, 1:42 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Not sure how they are nutritional...
10/15/17, 1:44 PM - Charles G: What kind of cereal?
10/15/17, 1:53 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Something they sell in Argentina
10/15/17, 3:09 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Hey just got back from a run. Girls want to talk for a couple mins?
10/15/17, 3:09 PM - Hannah Guedenet: I have to head Back for the opening ceremony in about 20 mins
10/15/17, 3:10 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Taking a quick shower
10/15/17, 3:16 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Done
10/15/17, 3:25 PM - Hannah Guedenet: The connection is awful
10/15/17, 4:44 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Hey before I forget. There will be an Amazon package coming.  It is markers from the Reddicks for c's birthday. You have a lot of wrapping to do...
10/15/17, 4:44 PM - Hannah Guedenet: So don't open the package.
10/15/17, 4:57 PM - Charles G: Ok
10/15/17, 4:57 PM - Charles G: How much cash do I need for Ana?
10/15/17, 4:58 PM - Charles G: I don't have enough
10/15/17, 4:59 PM - Charles G: And we haven't the checks
10/15/17, 4:59 PM - Charles G: *received
10/15/17, 5:14 PM - Hannah Guedenet: $129
10/15/17, 5:14 PM - Hannah Guedenet: $120
10/15/17, 7:51 PM - Charles G: Goodnight, babe. I miss you. Having a comfy bed only slightly makes up for it feeling so empty
10/15/17, 7:57 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Ahhh sleep well. I love you.
10/16/17, 4:48 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Morning babe! Thinking of you as you start your day. You are so amazing and I'm so thankful you are my partner and best friend. I know today is going to be hard but I LOVE YOU TRES BEAUCOUP !!!!! 😍😍😘😘😍😍
10/16/17, 4:55 AM - Charles G: Thanks,hun, for the message! 😊😋. You have a great day too.
10/16/17, 4:55 AM - Charles G: 😘
10/16/17, 4:56 AM - Charles G: I love you so so much. 💘
10/16/17, 7:02 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Two questions: 1) what time is your presentation to the board? And 2) did Melanie use the cash we left?
10/16/17, 7:12 AM - Charles G: <Media omitted>
10/16/17, 7:14 AM - Charles G: Board meeting isn't until next week. Today is just a run through with the exec team
10/16/17, 7:15 AM - Charles G: I think she did bc I don't see to the cash anywhere. I think she shopped at coop a bit
10/16/17, 7:47 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Good call on the alfajorde!
10/16/17, 7:47 AM - Hannah Guedenet: And did you think it was today? Maybe I totally misunderstood.
10/16/17, 8:34 AM - Hannah Guedenet: So....I figured out that there isn't much happening on Friday (which is annoying since when I looked at the schedule before booking my ticket, there was stuff). I emailed the travel agent to see what the cost would be to leave Thurs night. It is $300. Would it be worth it??
10/16/17, 9:03 AM - Charles G: I knew it was next week but was stressed because I didn't have anything ready for the run through, which will involve the president and senior staff
10/16/17, 9:03 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Ahhh ok
10/16/17, 9:07 AM - Charles G: I don't know. We've already spent so much money and to you would only be back one day early
10/16/17, 9:15 AM - Hannah Guedenet: I know. It would be fun to surprise her but it's a lot of money
10/16/17, 11:05 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Random musings for you (cause who else is going to listen to me)... The box sandwich lunch was appalling at the conference. It was crappy ham and cheese with a bad tasting apple. I'm torn over if I take per diem or not because I ended up buying an empanada from that place we stopped at on the tour. SO yummy!
10/16/17, 11:06 AM - Hannah Guedenet: So far the conference kind of sucks... I really haven't learned anything new or interesting.
10/16/17, 11:06 AM - Hannah Guedenet: But I guess there is still time.
10/16/17, 11:06 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Oh and back to food, the breakfast at the hotel is awful. Really wishing I had brought granola bars with me at least.
10/16/17, 11:09 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Ooohhh! I had the dulce de lèche Danette last night and it was scrumptious. Sorry you didn't try it!
10/16/17, 11:10 AM - Hannah Guedenet: And lastly I'm still blowing a lot of yellow junk out of my head.
10/16/17, 11:10 AM - Hannah Guedenet: And I'll finish the antibiotics tonight
10/16/17, 11:12 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Sorry one more. It's another absurdly beautiful day. I wish it had been like this last week...
10/16/17, 12:16 PM - Hannah Guedenet: <Media omitted>
10/16/17, 12:17 PM - Hannah Guedenet: And Addie's headband looks so cute!!
10/16/17, 12:17 PM - Hannah Guedenet: And she kept it in!
10/16/17, 2:45 PM - Charles G: So many things I want to comment on!
10/16/17, 2:47 PM - Charles G: Thanks for the updates. I don't know what to tell u about the perdiem but it seems unfair to eat crappy good when there's so much good food in BA.
10/16/17, 2:49 PM - Charles G: Do you have something to wrap the alfajores in? Martin took all the alfajores I have him...he was so happy. I was going to ask u to get more at the airport. I was disappointed in the ones we got in San telmo
10/16/17, 2:49 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Oh bummer! I can get some more at the airport. The ones at the hotel are super dry and don't taste like anything.
10/16/17, 2:49 PM - Hannah Guedenet: You'll have to tell me what you want.
10/16/17, 2:50 PM - Charles G: The meeting with internews was a little Rocky and my run through at the board meeting was very rough
10/16/17, 2:50 PM - Charles G: Not doing great today
10/16/17, 3:21 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Oh no babe. I'm sorry
10/16/17, 3:41 PM - Hannah Guedenet: At least it was just the run through and you have time to fix it
10/16/17, 7:00 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Hey babe. How you doing?
10/16/17, 7:00 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Missed video call
10/16/17, 7:03 PM - Hannah Guedenet: <Media omitted>
10/16/17, 7:08 PM - Charles G: Sorry, the video came too late. I'll share it with them tomorrow
10/16/17, 7:08 PM - Charles G: Doing ok. We got four eggs
10/16/17, 7:08 PM - Charles G: How are you?
10/16/17, 7:08 PM - Hannah Guedenet: No worries. I was talking with Ladd. You have a minute to talk?
10/16/17, 7:09 PM - Charles G: Sure
10/16/17, 7:09 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Would be easier than typing
10/16/17, 7:27 PM - Charles G: Btw, what wine bottle and I giving my parents? The white or the Malbec?
10/17/17, 4:29 AM - Hannah Guedenet: The Black label one. Not sure it's a Malbec or not
10/17/17, 8:18 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Talking/thinking a lot about obesity at the conference. Reminds me of my grad school days. And makes me want to get more involved with local food issues like school lunches. I need more time in my day!!
10/17/17, 10:07 AM - Charles G: <Media omitted>
10/17/17, 11:31 AM - Hannah Guedenet: <Media omitted>
10/17/17, 11:31 AM - Hannah Guedenet: And got a Starbucks coffee. Probably some of the best I've had. I have decided I don't like Argentinian coffee
10/17/17, 4:05 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Hey babe. Your day ok? I texted you on Skype but no response. I love you and miss you!
10/17/17, 4:51 PM - Charles G: Hey hun. Sorry, crazy long day.
10/17/17, 4:52 PM - Charles G: <Media omitted>
10/17/17, 4:52 PM - Charles G: Here's the weather forecast for this week, from Charlotte
10/17/17, 4:53 PM - Charles G: I had 6 hrs if meetings today
10/17/17, 5:58 PM - Hannah Guedenet: No need to apologize hun. I totally understand. The conference was a little more interesting today and I saw some people I know so that's always nice. 

But I'm about to burst. Ladd might be one of the most unpleasant people on the planet. And she is driving me nuts. There are just so many examples I don't know where to begin. Here's just a sample: she has told me on at least three occasions that USAID and gates have pursued her and tried to get her to come work for them. And she turned them down. She has a cat sitter who is not putting down the toilet seat which is just wrong (in her opinion). And she keeps telling me what a horrible job Charlotte is doing. At one point I finally said, "then do something about it!" She is going out tomorrow so I will hopefully have some quiet.
10/17/17, 5:58 PM - Hannah Guedenet: There is no session in the AM that interests me so I'm going to do some work. I feel a little overwhelmed with things. We are doing the brand reveal on Monday and it feels like there are a lot of moving pieces.
10/17/17, 5:59 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Ok that's it for me. Going to go read for awhile and hopefully get some sleep. My room is still super hot but they gave me a fan. This place is really crappy.
10/17/17, 7:02 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Oh and I love that video. She's so big.
10/17/17, 9:05 PM - Charles G: Thanks hun. I'm on our bed right now, listening to Addie having a little fit
10/17/17, 9:32 PM - Charles G: Ok. She's back in her bed now.
10/17/17, 9:33 PM - Charles G: Hey. Thanks again for the update. I'm glad the sessions were a little better and that you're meeting people.
10/17/17, 9:35 PM - Charles G: Also, Charlotte definitely seems like a difficult person. Who brags about getting job offers??   And do you think it's even true?!
10/17/17, 9:38 PM - Charles G: Today was the Cali quarterly meeting so there went 6 hours of my day. Then we had a 1 hour + meeting about the board presentations. I'm a little annoyed because I think Joy has made it more complicated than it needs to be. We ended the meeting with a much simplified outline that I suggested. I can't believe I'm spending all this time on a 7 min presentation!
10/17/17, 9:40 PM - Charles G: So far it's been really good to have my parents. It's a lot less stressful than usual for some reason. My dad is helping with lunches in the morning too. We're all going to Charlotte's school to celebrate her birthday with her on Friday. Yay!
10/17/17, 9:42 PM - Charles G: I completely forgot that I have a board meeting tomorrow. It's at Matthews house with the new board members. I really don't want to go. I just want to be with my girls and I feel so disengaged from crcc.
10/17/17, 9:43 PM - Charles G: Ok. That's all from me. Love you!! Btw, the girls loved your video. I forgot to video their fav things. Sorry....
10/18/17, 5:18 AM - Charles G: Good morning, babe. I hope you get a lot done this morning. Love you!
10/18/17, 5:27 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Thank you so much hun. I hope your day is good too. My alarm didn't go off so I'm just now up. Going to grab some coffee from Starbucks and get going... hopefully. I stayed up too late again reading a book. That is why I can't read books...I have no self control.
10/18/17, 5:27 AM - Hannah Guedenet: I hope your day is a little more productive today. (and you go to bed earlier!!)
10/18/17, 5:28 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Also I think you meant Ladd is a difficult person. Not Charlotte.
10/18/17, 5:28 AM - Charles G: Yeah, my alarm didn't go off yesterday and I ended up sleeping in . I didn't sleep great last night... Went to bed late and then kept waking up
10/18/17, 5:29 AM - Charles G: Yes, I meant Ladd
10/18/17, 5:30 AM - Hannah Guedenet: I'll be home soon then we can cuddle and make sure we both sleep well!
10/18/17, 5:30 AM - Hannah Guedenet: 3 more sleeps!
10/18/17, 5:42 AM - Charles G: Yep 😚
10/18/17, 6:10 AM - Hannah Guedenet: You have a KA orchard trip on our calendar. I am pretty sure that is for the 4s class...
10/18/17, 6:58 AM - Charles G: Yeah. I forgot the permission slip. I'll scan and send at work.
10/18/17, 6:58 AM - Hannah Guedenet: It's not for her class!
10/18/17, 6:58 AM - Hannah Guedenet: It's for the older class
10/18/17, 6:59 AM - Charles G: I feel like I've gotten more forgetful over the past few weeks. It's frustrating
10/18/17, 6:59 AM - Hannah Guedenet: The 2s class doesn't go on field trips.
10/18/17, 6:59 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Babe...THE HOOTING OWLS are going on the field trup
10/18/17, 6:59 AM - Charles G: Oh, she's not an be owl?
10/18/17, 6:59 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Trip
10/18/17, 7:00 AM - Hannah Guedenet: NO!!!
10/18/17, 7:00 AM - Hannah Guedenet: She is a bird or something
10/18/17, 7:00 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Please don't worry about the permission slip
10/18/17, 7:00 AM - Hannah Guedenet: You're not at work yet?
10/18/17, 7:00 AM - Charles G: Ok
10/18/17, 7:00 AM - Charles G: No, in metro
10/18/17, 7:07 AM - Hannah Guedenet: I thought you got in earlier with your parents there
10/18/17, 7:07 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Ugh I need to plan my burkina trip and I really do not want to go for 10 days
10/18/17, 7:24 AM - Charles G: Yeah, sucks you have to travel so soon. Sorry
10/18/17, 7:24 AM - Hannah Guedenet: I forwarded you the October newsletter from KA. Not sure if you get those emails
10/18/17, 7:24 AM - Charles G: <Media omitted>
10/18/17, 7:25 AM - Hannah Guedenet: They look so big
10/18/17, 7:55 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Todays Carter's birthday btw
10/18/17, 11:05 AM - Hannah Guedenet: I am so tired of eating out. I just want to come home and cook a meal full of veggies!
10/18/17, 11:06 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Also I sent an email about c's birthday. I need to know about the sleepover so I can send Anna a message.
10/18/17, 11:06 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Hope your day is going ok.
10/18/17, 3:15 PM - Charles G: I finally had a good day at the office and got a few things done that had been hanging over my head. I don't feel like I'm drowning as much anymore
10/18/17, 3:34 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Very good news!! I've gotten sucked into going to a tango show with some of the Gates folks. It is a little pricey but includes dinner and drinks.
10/18/17, 3:35 PM - Hannah Guedenet: And the good news was about you. Not me being sucked into dinner.
10/18/17, 3:35 PM - Hannah Guedenet: I feel a little better too after getting some work done this morning. Had a good meeting with Jean Marie this afternoon too
10/18/17, 3:37 PM - Charles G: How late is the tango show?
10/18/17, 3:38 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Starts at 10
10/18/17, 3:38 PM - Charles G: I'm glad you had a better day today
10/18/17, 3:38 PM - Hannah Guedenet: I feel bad spending the money
10/18/17, 3:38 PM - Hannah Guedenet: I'm still getting spam calls from Argentina...
10/18/17, 3:38 PM - Charles G: Oh, 10 is late but not too bad
10/18/17, 3:38 PM - Charles G: Weird
10/18/17, 3:38 PM - Hannah Guedenet: That's when it starts but yes not as bad as 12 or 1
10/18/17, 3:38 PM - Hannah Guedenet: You going to the board meeting?
10/18/17, 3:39 PM - Charles G: It'll be a late dinner
10/18/17, 3:39 PM - Hannah Guedenet: I am so ready to come home. Just can't believe I have to leave again in a little over 2 weeks
10/18/17, 3:39 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Yes
10/18/17, 3:39 PM - Hannah Guedenet: I haven't been going to ssleep until midnight all week though
10/18/17, 3:40 PM - Hannah Guedenet: See my question about board meeting?
10/18/17, 3:40 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Jumping in shower
10/18/17, 3:41 PM - Charles G: Yeah, and then you'll probably have to travel for wenta
10/18/17, 3:43 PM - Charles G: Yeah, I'm going to the board meeting. It's at Matthews house
10/18/17, 3:49 PM - Hannah Guedenet: I'm hoping I don't have to travel for awhile.
10/18/17, 3:49 PM - Hannah Guedenet: But we'll see I guess. I also don't know what role I'll have on WENTA
10/18/17, 3:49 PM - Hannah Guedenet: We still haven't gotten comments...
10/18/17, 3:50 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Have fun at the meeting. At least you know you'll eat and drink well!
10/18/17, 7:57 PM - Hannah Guedenet: I miss you. Come back to Argentina
10/18/17, 8:25 PM - Charles G: I miss you too. I got back from the board meeting at 10pmand have a lot in want to tell you but am just too tired. Sorry
10/18/17, 8:27 PM - Charles G: I will say that my parents did great with the girls while I was away. The girls live my mom's simple dinners and they actually asked for a bath. My mom seemed so happy when she described the evening
10/18/17, 8:41 PM - Hannah Guedenet: I'm so glad. Basically I never need to come home...
10/18/17, 9:28 PM - Hannah Guedenet: I miss you all so much. Ive had a few glasses of wine and some whiskey. But I just want you to know how much I love hou
10/18/17, 9:28 PM - Hannah Guedenet: You
10/18/17, 9:28 PM - Hannah Guedenet: And how thankful I am to have you in my life
10/18/17, 9:31 PM - Hannah Guedenet: I really can't imagine life without you.
10/19/17, 5:28 AM - Hannah Guedenet: TWO MORE SLEEPS!!!
10/19/17, 5:36 AM - Charles G: Hey babe. Thanks for your tipsy message last night 😋.
10/19/17, 5:36 AM - Charles G: You have fun?
10/19/17, 5:39 AM - Hannah Guedenet: It was fun yes. I have a horrible headache this morning.
10/19/17, 5:39 AM - Hannah Guedenet: I still mean it this AM...even when not tipsy
10/19/17, 5:40 AM - Hannah Guedenet: How was your evening? Looks like you were up late
10/19/17, 5:51 AM - Hannah Guedenet: I'm in a session on climate change and nutrition. We need to eat less meat.
10/19/17, 8:52 AM - Hannah Guedenet: I'm now in a session on data visualization for nutrition. The guy built his model in R!! He's one of your people!!
10/19/17, 10:27 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Can you resend me the video of Charlotte? It won't play for me for some reason
10/19/17, 11:57 AM - Charles G: My people! Haha
10/19/17, 11:57 AM - Charles G: Sure
10/19/17, 11:57 AM - Charles G: <Media omitted>
10/19/17, 2:27 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Hey how are the chickens?
10/19/17, 2:28 PM - Hannah Guedenet: And I'd love to talk to the girls tonight. Going to dinner with Jean Marie at 8 my time so maybe around 6:30 your time we can talk?
10/19/17, 2:29 PM - Hannah Guedenet: I also want to hear about the board meeting. You could send me a voice message?
10/19/17, 2:32 PM - Charles G: We have so many eggs! We may be having scrambled eggs soon
10/19/17, 2:32 PM - Charles G: Yeah, let's shoot for 6:39
10/19/17, 2:32 PM - Charles G: 6:30
10/19/17, 2:32 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Or one of your dad's omelettes? Those are good
10/19/17, 2:32 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Will you be home by then?
10/19/17, 2:32 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Your day going ok?
10/19/17, 2:32 PM - Charles G: Yeah, I would ask him
10/19/17, 2:33 PM - Charles G: Yeah, lll be home then
10/19/17, 2:33 PM - Charles G: Yeah, it's been a good day overall. Terrible last night though
10/19/17, 2:34 PM - Charles G: Addie first fell out of bed and then an hour later had one of her crying fits. I didn't sleep much
10/19/17, 2:34 PM - Charles G: How was your day?
10/19/17, 2:35 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Oh gosh. That sounds bad. I'm sorry
10/19/17, 2:35 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Not feeling great. Super bad headache all day and pretty sick to my stomach. I don't know if it was all I drank last night but I feel pretty rotten.
10/19/17, 3:03 PM - Charles G: I want to hear about your tango night at one point
10/19/17, 3:04 PM - Charles G: Sorry you're not feeling good, hun. You running at all? I did my first run this morning since getting back and it felt great
10/19/17, 3:06 PM - Hannah Guedenet: I ran once on Sunday and it was nice but the city center is really crowded. I just haven't felt up to navigating it. I ran on the treadmill a bit and did the bike.
10/19/17, 3:08 PM - Hannah Guedenet: We're now doing dinner at 7:30. what time will you be home?
10/19/17, 3:59 PM - Charles G: I'll be home in 15-20 mins
10/19/17, 4:03 PM - Charles G: Is it confirmed that Lea is coming Saturday?
10/19/17, 4:03 PM - Charles G: Also, did you want us to wait until sat to open any presents?
10/19/17, 4:05 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Oh shoot thanks for the reminder!!! I will text Anna now
10/19/17, 4:05 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Maybe we can talk right before bed time
10/19/17, 4:07 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Btw Anna wants to have c over for a sleepover on Nov 11 for Leah's birthday. I'll be in Burkina
10/19/17, 4:08 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Re presents. I hate to ask c to wait to open presents until I'm home. That seems mean
10/19/17, 4:08 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Maybe you can record it for me?
10/19/17, 4:28 PM - Charles G: I'm home. Want to Skype?
10/19/17, 4:42 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Plans changed. Can we do before bedtime?
10/19/17, 4:45 PM - Charles G: Sure
10/19/17, 4:48 PM - Charles G: <Media omitted>

10/20/17, 11:30 AM - Charles G: Yes! Two more boxes of the two-packs at the airport. So four. Don't know if they're cheaper at the actual cafe
10/20/17, 11:37 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Ok. Well I'm not going to have time to go to Cafe.
10/20/17, 11:37 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Is there still a box for me to take to work?

10/20/17, 2:40 PM - Hannah Guedenet: <Media omitted>
10/20/17, 2:40 PM - Hannah Guedenet: How long did customs take for you?
10/20/17, 2:40 PM - Hannah Guedenet: We are still in traffic. It's going to end up taking over 2 hours...
10/20/17, 2:42 PM - Hannah Guedenet: I loathe Ladd.
10/20/17, 2:45 PM - Charles G: Customs took awhile.
10/20/17, 2:45 PM - Charles G: But the delta line took the longest. Fortunately, you have priority
10/20/17, 2:46 PM - Charles G: Did u see my question about Addie?
10/20/17, 2:46 PM - Hannah Guedenet: I did. I sent a voice message with the response. Too complicated to type
10/20/17, 2:49 PM - Charles G: I can't believe traffic is so bad. It only took me 45 minutes 😮
10/20/17, 2:49 PM - Charles G: Thanks for the audio message! Received
10/20/17, 2:50 PM - Hannah Guedenet: I know. I figured 1.5 would be plenty of time. It's going to be at least 2.5 hours
10/20/17, 2:56 PM - Charles G: Yikes. That is crazy
10/20/17, 3:06 PM - Charles G: You on the same flight as Last?

10/20/17, 4:35 PM - Charles G: I didn't buy them in terminal. I bought them in tax free store
10/20/17, 4:35 PM - Charles G: We'll, I mean in the terminal but not in the cafe
10/20/17, 4:35 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Oh then maybe I bought the wrong thing.mm

10/20/17, 4:52 PM - Hannah Guedenet: On the plane! See you tomorrow. Cannot wait!!
10/20/17, 5:02 PM - Hannah Guedenet: The flight attendant who is making the announcements sounds like a late night 1-900 operator.
10/20/17, 5:03 PM - Charles G: Ha!
10/20/17, 5:03 PM - Hannah Guedenet: And of course I didn't get Delta comfort on this flight...
10/20/17, 5:03 PM - Charles G: Oh man. Sorry...
10/20/17, 5:03 PM - Charles G: My flight was packed
10/20/17, 5:04 PM - Charles G: Have a good flight, sleep if you can. Love you babe

10/20/17, 5:05 PM - Charles G: Very cool
10/20/17, 5:05 PM - Hannah Guedenet: And hoping the ambien works. What are y'all doing for dinner?
10/20/17, 5:10 PM - Hannah Guedenet: And did you eat the food? Was it worth it?
10/20/17, 5:10 PM - Charles G: We're eating pizza. What food?
10/20/17, 5:11 PM - Hannah Guedenet: On the plane
10/20/17, 5:12 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Ok have to turn phone off. Love you!! Xoxox
10/20/17, 5:12 PM - Charles G: Oh that. Yeah, dinner was actually ok
10/20/17, 5:13 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Ok cool
10/20/17, 5:13 PM - Hannah Guedenet: 😘
10/20/17, 5:13 PM - Charles G: Ok. Love you!!!!! Bye
10/21/17, 4:30 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Arrived in Atlanta. Got through customs easily and my bag was waiting for me. I took an ambien and slept a bit. Still feeling tired.
10/21/17, 4:32 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Btw Allison is having a birthday party for Seydou tonight. Not sure we can go though.
10/21/17, 4:33 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Oh and we are going to a Halloween party at the Goldbergs next Saturday. And Debdatta invited us to a Diwali party on Nov 4
10/21/17, 4:33 AM - Hannah Guedenet: In the evening so you won't miss your bonsai.
10/21/17, 5:13 AM - Charles G: Our social calendar is filling up!
10/21/17, 5:14 AM - Charles G: Glad you slept some.
10/21/17, 5:20 AM - Hannah Guedenet: You're up early
10/21/17, 5:20 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Girls not let you sleep in a bit?
10/21/17, 5:30 AM - Hannah Guedenet: I forgot to tell you. I had a mini panic attack on the plane.
10/21/17, 5:31 AM - Hannah Guedenet: I think it was something with the pressure in my ears. I felt super claustrophobic. The lady next to me had to calm me down.
10/21/17, 5:31 AM - Charles G: No, our stupid cat
10/21/17, 5:31 AM - Hannah Guedenet: It was so weird.
10/21/17, 5:31 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Damn Nutella
10/21/17, 5:32 AM - Hannah Guedenet: The sunrise is beautiful here.
10/21/17, 5:35 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Looks like we're leaving on time. About to board.
10/21/17, 5:35 AM - Hannah Guedenet: The people who work at the airport are ridiculously friendly.
10/21/17, 5:36 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Oh and I am still dizzy. Day 3. And my stomach is weird.
10/21/17, 5:37 AM - Charles G: Well, that's scary. I'm sorry
10/21/17, 5:37 AM - Charles G: It's southern hospitality
10/21/17, 5:38 AM - Charles G: You should see a doctor
10/21/17, 5:42 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Yeah it was unpleasant. I am still blowing stuff out of my head. So think I just had pressure. It got better once we leveled off
10/21/17, 5:54 AM - Hannah Guedenet: On the plane. Man next to me has to be at least 300 lbs
10/21/17, 5:58 AM - Charles G: Oh man. That sucks
10/21/17, 5:58 AM - Charles G: Welcome to america
10/21/17, 5:59 AM - Charles G: Coming back, I was stuck by how much bigger every one is. I felt more normal sized in BA
10/21/17, 5:59 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Yeah. It is pretty shocking.
10/21/17, 5:59 AM - Hannah Guedenet: I also think we're in a bit of a bubble in the area where we live.
10/21/17, 6:29 AM - Hannah Guedenet: I'm in the air. Apparently I can WhatsApp for free.
10/21/17, 6:30 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Could you bring me a bottle of ice water when you come to get me ? And maybe some fruit?
10/21/17, 6:30 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Looks like we'll arrive on time at 10
10/21/17, 6:32 AM - Charles G: Ok
10/21/17, 7:41 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Landed!
10/21/17, 7:42 AM - Charles G: In our way!
10/21/17, 7:44 AM - Hannah Guedenet: And you know I'm at BWI right?
10/21/17, 8:08 AM - Hannah Guedenet: I'm between d1 and d2
10/21/17, 1:33 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Think your sister just have used our 10%
10/21/17, 1:35 PM - Charles G: Ah, not surprised. We should have told her it was a once a month thing
10/21/17, 1:36 PM - Charles G: My mom may have
10/21/17, 1:41 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Yeah
10/21/17, 7:00 PM - Hannah Guedenet: You coming up?
10/21/17, 7:01 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Hello??
10/21/17, 7:02 PM - Charles G: Yeah
10/21/17, 7:02 PM - Charles G: Yes!
10/22/17, 2:57 PM - Hannah Guedenet: We're headed back. Lil c seems a little down.
10/22/17, 3:05 PM - Charles G: Ok. Bummer. Waking up A
10/23/17, 4:51 AM - Charles G: What time is the brand unveiling?
10/23/17, 4:52 AM - Hannah Guedenet: 11 with ASI then 1 with AV
10/23/17, 4:52 AM - Hannah Guedenet: It is so spooky out!
10/23/17, 4:56 AM - Charles G: You're gonna crush it.
10/23/17, 4:56 AM - Charles G: Yeah, can't wait for time change
10/23/17, 4:59 AM - Hannah Guedenet: We need to find the bike lights...
10/23/17, 4:59 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Thanks babe
10/23/17, 5:10 AM - Hannah Guedenet: I'm listening to planet money about the Equifax hack. We should put a freeze on our credit scores -- it means no one can open new accounts or get credit
10/23/17, 5:11 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Apparently they usually charge for it but Equifax is so kindly waiving the fee. How generous of them. (sarcasm)
10/23/17, 5:21 AM - Charles G: Out a freeze on our credit scores? What does that mean?
10/23/17, 6:18 AM - Hannah Guedenet: We can talk tonight.
10/23/17, 6:18 AM - Hannah Guedenet: So turns out Ana only has me speaking on two slides for the presentation...
10/23/17, 6:18 AM - Hannah Guedenet: I'm pretty annoyed
10/23/17, 10:37 AM - Charles G: Sorry hun. That's weird. I hope the 1pm prez goes well.
10/23/17, 10:38 AM - Charles G: I'm just now in the metro. Was on a bunch of calls about Syria this morning
10/23/17, 10:55 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Wow. Why are you even going inmm
10/23/17, 10:55 AM - Hannah Guedenet: In??
10/23/17, 10:55 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Went fine. Nervous about this one...
10/23/17, 12:50 PM - Charles G: How did it go?
10/23/17, 12:59 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Skyped you
10/23/17, 1:24 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Car is on Holly I assume?
10/23/17, 4:16 PM - Charles G: No bikes...
10/23/17, 4:16 PM - Charles G: I shouldn't have gotten a ride share fob
10/23/17, 4:18 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Sorry babe
10/23/17, 4:18 PM - Hannah Guedenet: That is frustrating
10/23/17, 4:28 PM - Charles G: On a very hot 16 bus
10/23/17, 4:32 PM - Charles G: I should have walked hime. Traffic is awful
10/23/17, 4:37 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Oh man...
10/23/17, 4:37 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Well I checked on chickens and managed to break the feeder again
10/23/17, 4:42 PM - Charles G: Almost home
10/23/17, 4:43 PM - Charles G: Oh no! You must shake it a different way. That sucks
10/23/17, 8:08 PM - Charles G: <Media omitted>
10/24/17, 4:41 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Just got an email from the AV gender advisor from Kenya, Lydia. She's going to be in town next week and wants to go to church with us. She's had dinner with us before but it's been awhile. Just fyi.
10/24/17, 4:42 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Sorry I was short this am. I started off in a funk and can't seem to shake. Plus I'm exhausted. Slept horribly.
10/24/17, 4:48 AM - Charles G: That would great. Neat that she wants to go to church with us.
10/24/17, 4:49 AM - Charles G: I'm sorry you're in a funk and didn't sleep well. You have a full day?
10/24/17, 4:50 AM - Charles G: I really am sorry about the coffee. For some reason, I thought I had more time.
10/24/17, 4:51 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Lots of meetings in the later part of the day. And now Jana who was supposed to organize this sunday's neighborhood fall festival is totally bailing. Hayley and I are going to have to figure it out.
10/24/17, 4:51 AM - Hannah Guedenet: We will have to go to Costco on Saturday which is fine because we need stuff.
10/24/17, 4:53 AM - Charles G: Sorry, babe...
10/24/17, 4:56 AM - Hannah Guedenet: It's fine. I really want off this board. It was a huge mistake volunteering.
10/24/17, 4:56 AM - Hannah Guedenet: I emailed faith about the baby stuff. It felt a little awkward.
10/24/17, 4:58 AM - Hannah Guedenet: I also hate not biking but it's so dark when I leave. I forgot how much I loathe the buses.
10/24/17, 5:01 AM - Charles G: I'm sure faith will appreciate it. She seems to be the kind of person that will just accept what has happened and will try to do what she can to help alea. It is what it is.
10/24/17, 5:13 AM - Charles G: Btw, thanks a lot for doing dishes and encouraging me to go play soccer with a bunch of kids. I love you so much. So lucky to have you.... 😘
10/24/17, 5:14 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Any time babe. I hope you'll do it again.
10/24/17, 3:27 PM - Hannah Guedenet: You able to leave a little early today?
10/24/17, 3:46 PM - Hannah Guedenet: You headed home?
10/24/17, 3:51 PM - Charles G: Yeah. I'm on metro. Couldn't leave early. I'll have to work tonight too. The Syria research data came in and we need to send analysis to donor asap
10/24/17, 3:53 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Ugh how awful
10/24/17, 4:28 PM - Charles G: Well crap. I took the 12 to coop so I could take bike share. Doesn't work. When we cancelled our CC, we didn't update bike share
10/24/17, 4:36 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Oh shoot
10/24/17, 4:36 PM - Hannah Guedenet: I'm sorry. I will do that
10/24/17, 4:36 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Wait do you not have your fob?
10/24/17, 4:37 PM - Charles G: I do. It gets rejected
10/31/17, 6:02 AM - Charles G: Hey guys. Mike is leaving tonight and wants to get coda from the bus stop. Don't worry about taking her home today!
10/31/17, 6:02 AM - Charles G: That's from Sari
11/18/17, 7:42 PM - Charles G: Hey. Sorry we're not connecting. You coming upstairs? I love you
11/18/17, 7:43 PM - Hannah Guedenet: I love you too. I am in a minute
11/20/17, 10:26 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Please don't forget to send me the health insurance info for HQ
11/20/17, 3:41 PM - Charles G: Biking home
11/20/17, 3:59 PM - Hannah Guedenet: We're here!
11/21/17, 7:54 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Wow whole foods is crowded and it's Tuesday morning!
11/21/17, 7:55 AM - Charles G: That stinks. Sorry
11/25/17, 1:19 PM - Hannah Guedenet: I know this is going to sound strange since I'm out shopping but I'm insanely horny. We have to have sex and soon.
11/25/17, 1:26 PM - Hannah Guedenet: There's a hidden brain episode on now you would really like.
11/25/17, 1:28 PM - Charles G: Yes, I've been horny too. Let's do something about that tomorrow!
11/25/17, 1:28 PM - Charles G: What's the episode about?
11/25/17, 1:28 PM - Charles G: Should I wake Charlotte up?
11/25/17, 1:34 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Yeah wake her up. About something called deep work.
11/25/17, 1:35 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Can you ask your dad how much fish to get per person? I can't remember
11/25/17, 1:36 PM - Hannah Guedenet: It's actually really interesting
11/25/17, 1:37 PM - Hannah Guedenet: https://www.npr.org/2017/07/25/539092670/you-2-0-the-value-of-deep-work-in-an-age-of-distraction
11/25/17, 1:37 PM - Hannah Guedenet: I don't feel great
11/25/17, 1:39 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Please find out about the fish. Almost to Martin's
11/25/17, 1:40 PM - Charles G: Ok. Looking for him
11/25/17, 1:41 PM - Charles G: Melanie says 200g per person
11/25/17, 1:41 PM - Charles G: 200g per little girl
11/25/17, 1:50 PM - Hannah Guedenet: What is that in lbs? Sheesh...
11/25/17, 1:50 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Never mind I'll look it up
11/25/17, 1:50 PM - Hannah Guedenet: I'm confused. 200 per person or per little girl??
11/25/17, 1:51 PM - Hannah Guedenet: I'll get a little over 2.5 lbs.
11/25/17, 1:52 PM - Hannah Guedenet: But please confirm if the 200 is for adult or chjld.
11/25/17, 2:05 PM - Hannah Guedenet: You r dad said to get the haddock
11/25/17, 2:05 PM - Hannah Guedenet: But they don't have enough
11/25/17, 2:06 PM - Charles G: Argh
11/25/17, 2:06 PM - Charles G: Get as much of that as they have plus something else? Salmon?
11/25/17, 2:22 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Ugh
11/25/17, 2:23 PM - Hannah Guedenet: <Media omitted>
11/25/17, 2:27 PM - Charles G: Ok. We'll make it work
11/25/17, 3:03 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Addie wants you to come get her
11/25/17, 3:03 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Please
11/27/17, 5:30 AM - Charles G: Two k6 and one k9 all arrived at the same time!
11/27/17, 5:32 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Choices!!
11/27/17, 5:43 AM - Hannah Guedenet: By the way you were 14/74 for your age group. Very respectable.
11/27/17, 5:44 AM - Hannah Guedenet: And I was 14/118
11/27/17, 5:56 AM - Charles G: Wow! You rock!! I did pretty good too.
11/27/17, 6:02 AM - Hannah Guedenet: You did awesome. We were both 14!!
11/27/17, 6:03 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Girls are still asleep. Guess I should get them up...
11/27/17, 6:04 AM - Charles G: Yeah, probably.
11/27/17, 7:22 AM - Charles G: I have a cavity 😣
11/27/17, 7:29 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Oh no! Addie wants to know if you cried
11/27/17, 7:33 AM - Charles G: Ha! She really said that?
11/27/17, 7:34 AM - Charles G: No, but it was very painful. I need to floss more. My gums are in bad shape
11/27/17, 7:34 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Yes she did. She is not excited about this appt
11/27/17, 8:13 AM - Charles G: Poor thing
11/27/17, 8:33 AM - Hannah Guedenet: No cavities. Girls need to floss. It was cool because I could see c's new teeth coming in on the xeay
11/27/17, 8:38 AM - Charles G: Yay for no cavities. How did Addie do? Do you like the new dentist?
11/27/17, 8:40 AM - Hannah Guedenet: I do like her. No lectures. She said to floss. Addie laid on my lap and did fine. Lil c had a really hard time with the x-rays. Cried.
11/27/17, 8:40 AM - Hannah Guedenet: I'm also boxed into a parking spot. Going to be very hard to get out.
11/27/17, 8:41 AM - Charles G: Yeah, x-rays are uncomfortable
11/27/17, 8:46 AM - Hannah Guedenet: That's what I told her
11/27/17, 3:29 PM - Charles G: I'm at noma
11/27/17, 3:29 PM - Charles G: It's the last stop for some reason.
11/27/17, 3:30 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Hmmm they must be doing shorter trains through the busiest part
11/27/17, 3:30 PM - Hannah Guedenet: I'm afraid New Hampshire is going to be awesome but not sure what option you have
11/27/17, 3:30 PM - Hannah Guedenet: You get the ok to work from home?
11/27/17, 3:30 PM - Charles G: And next train for FT IN 8 minutes. Ugh

11/27/17, 3:31 PM - Charles G: You mean, not awesome
11/27/17, 3:31 PM - Hannah Guedenet: You should just work from home the whole time...
11/27/17, 3:31 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Awful...
11/27/17, 3:31 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Not awesome

11/29/17, 4:05 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Seriously??? Why did you get on the noma train???
11/29/17, 4:05 PM - Hannah Guedenet: This is crazy.
11/29/17, 4:11 PM - Charles G: It wouldn't have been any faster if I'd gotten on the FT one
11/29/17, 4:12 PM - Charles G: Waiting for k9 or k6
11/29/17, 4:16 PM - Charles G: I'm on k6 and we're leaving
11/29/17, 4:25 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Ugh this is insane
11/29/17, 4:25 PM - Charles G: Yes, traffic is awful!! We are going at snail's pace
11/29/17, 4:25 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Oh babe...
11/29/17, 4:26 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Maybe you should have tried a shuttle...but I guess that's not better
11/29/17, 4:26 PM - Hannah Guedenet: So glad you're only going in twice a week
11/29/17, 4:27 PM - Charles G: It took forever just to leave the station bc we had to go around the loop. Just now got out!!
11/29/17, 4:27 PM - Charles G: The lines to get into the shuttles are insane
11/29/17, 4:28 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Oh good grief. You're never going to get home!!!
11/29/17, 4:28 PM - Hannah Guedenet: The k6 takes forever.
11/30/17, 5:00 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Wow I just barely got a red line train. Otherwise it would have been a 10 min wait
11/30/17, 7:03 AM - Charles G: Good!

11/30/17, 1:44 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Getting on train at Union

12/2/17, 11:19 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Here at 1:19 and doors not open...
12/2/17, 11:25 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Also had a thought. Is there a listserv for the French school? We could post about our summer plans and ask for tips on finding child care
12/2/17, 11:25 AM - Hannah Guedenet: And maybe a car??
12/2/17, 11:27 AM - Charles G: Weird that doors aren't open
12/2/17, 11:28 AM - Charles G: Good idea about talking into the French school community. I don't know of a listserv but can ask
12/2/17, 11:31 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Patricia didn't seem ok when I saw her
12/2/17, 11:35 AM - Charles G: Frazzled?
12/2/17, 11:36 AM - Hannah Guedenet: I asked if she went to the party and she said yes but left early. I mentioned we stayed home because of Addie. And she said she should have too. I asked if she didn't feel well because she seemed low energy. She just said it was a long story...
12/2/17, 11:49 AM - Charles G: Oh. I hope everything's ok. You think something happened at the party? Too much drunkenness?
12/2/17, 11:51 AM - Hannah Guedenet: I don't know
12/2/17, 1:51 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Picking up c. I'm going to need a short nap. I feel like crap again. Stopped at Trader Joe's. It was so stressful. SO crowded!!!

12/5/17, 2:32 PM - Charles G: Shoot. Wouldn't have seen your message in time anyways
12/5/17, 2:34 PM - Hannah Guedenet: It's ok. Almost to East West. The heart palpitations are bad and I'm so tired.
12/5/17, 2:43 PM - Charles G: I'm worried about you. Can we call my dad tonight?
12/7/17, 5:16 AM - Hannah Guedenet: I forgot to tell you. Lauren texted. She is going to be in DC next Thursday and wants to meet for dinner. Does that work?
12/7/17, 5:19 AM - Hannah Guedenet: We could switch that day if it works for you.

12/9/17, 5:31 PM - Charles G: Oh my goodness. Still here! They're de-icing or something. The guy next to me is watching something that involves an anniversary yelling in Arabic. Very unpleasant. I think it's a soccer game

12/9/17, 7:30 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Just got the girls to bed. Not a horrible time but just slow. They were in pretty good spirits though c got really sad because she missed you.
12/9/17, 7:30 PM - Hannah Guedenet: And you were totally right about not doing two nights of sleepover. one night was enough.
12/9/17, 7:34 PM - Hannah Guedenet: You are very wise.
12/10/17, 5:26 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Did you arrive????
12/10/17, 5:27 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Are you ok??
12/10/17, 5:28 AM - Charles G: Hey there!

12/10/17, 5:29 AM - Charles G: How'd the night go?

12/10/17, 5:32 AM - Charles G: Sorry
12/10/17, 5:32 AM - Charles G: Why was she crying? Bad dream?
12/10/17, 5:33 AM - Hannah Guedenet: I don't know. She's a pain. She just wants me to sit next to her bed. I told her to come into our bed but instead she is just making crying noises from her bed.
12/10/17, 5:37 AM - Charles G: Weird
12/10/17, 5:37 AM - Charles G: She's gonna wake Charlotte
12/10/17, 5:43 AM - Charles G: You guys wanna chat this morning?
12/10/17, 5:47 AM - Hannah Guedenet: OMG. Huge huge huge meltdown. Like bigger than what happened at your parents. I'm sure c is awake now. She gets to where she is possessed. And of course I get upset. I hate this
12/10/17, 5:58 AM - Charles G: Oh no!!
12/10/17, 5:59 AM - Charles G: Bigger than yesterday?
12/10/17, 6:03 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Yesterday??
12/10/17, 6:03 AM - Hannah Guedenet: <Media omitted>
12/10/17, 6:08 AM - Charles G: I guess it was Friday when I locked her in the bathroom until she cooled down
12/10/17, 6:08 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Yes worse
12/10/17, 6:09 AM - Charles G: She's a booger
12/10/17, 6:09 AM - Charles G: I'm so sorry babe

12/10/17, 6:40 AM - Hannah Guedenet: She's possessed. And yes we're going to church. Just have to get out of bed. Still having heart palpitations.

12/10/17, 6:43 AM - Hannah Guedenet: <Media omitted>
12/10/17, 7:05 AM - Hannah Guedenet: I think aubin is annoyed with us and not doing more on the coop
12/10/17, 7:05 AM - Hannah Guedenet: I'm not sure we're making it to church...
12/10/17, 7:05 AM - Hannah Guedenet: But not sure what we would do instead.
12/10/17, 8:51 AM - Charles G: You guys not go finally?
12/10/17, 8:51 AM - Charles G: I've stumbled upon the coolest outdoor market
12/10/17, 8:51 AM - Charles G: <Media omitted>
12/10/17, 8:52 AM - Charles G: I wish you were here to enjoy it with
12/10/17, 9:00 AM - Hannah Guedenet: So cool. We came. Just a bit late. And the car is running on fumes.
12/10/17, 9:05 AM - Hannah Guedenet: You're responsible for a small stocking gift if you see something small that you could get
12/10/17, 9:21 AM - Charles G: Ok
12/10/17, 9:21 AM - Charles G: Found a present for me..
12/10/17, 9:21 AM - Charles G: Slippers
12/10/17, 9:42 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Haha.
12/10/17, 9:44 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Addie is having another complete meltdown. She's mad because I won't let her eat the candy cane from church.
12/10/17, 9:44 AM - Hannah Guedenet: She's a nightmare
12/10/17, 9:50 AM - Hannah Guedenet: <Media omitted>
12/10/17, 9:50 AM - Hannah Guedenet: I put in over 17 gallons!!!
12/10/17, 9:55 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Merry Christmas to you. Guess I don't need to get you anything.
12/10/17, 10:01 AM - Charles G: Didn't get slippers finally cause he didn't take credit cards and I didn't have enough cash
12/10/17, 10:01 AM - Charles G: But I got a stocking stuffer although it was kind of pricey so maybe a gift gift
12/10/17, 10:06 AM - Charles G: And sorry about Addie. Maybe the sleepover and then me leaving disrupted her routine too much?
12/10/17, 10:07 AM - Charles G: I have to say that seeing parents with cute babies at the airport and plane did not make want another one. So glad we're past that is
12/10/17, 10:15 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Haha. We're not having any more!!!
12/10/17, 10:15 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Can you go back to the market??
12/10/17, 10:16 AM - Hannah Guedenet: I will stop telling you about what's happening. Enjoy yourself!!
12/10/17, 10:16 AM - Hannah Guedenet: What time is it there? We're having lunch.
12/10/17, 10:18 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Does it get dark at 4 there???
12/10/17, 10:20 AM - Charles G: Yeah, it gets by 3:45 or so...kind of depressing. My body is all confused.
12/10/17, 10:20 AM - Charles G: I'm finishing up dinner at Japanese restaurant
12/10/17, 10:27 AM - Charles G: It's snowing in Berlin now
12/10/17, 10:33 AM - Hannah Guedenet: We're eating Japanese too!! 😀
12/10/17, 10:33 AM - Hannah Guedenet: You're eating Japanese in Berlin???

12/10/17, 10:46 AM - Hannah Guedenet: I'm still having palpitations. Definitely going to doctor tomorrow
12/10/17, 10:47 AM - Hannah Guedenet: <Media omitted>

12/10/17, 10:48 AM - Charles G: That's really cute
12/10/17, 10:49 AM - Charles G: 😘
12/10/17, 10:51 AM - Hannah Guedenet: I meant the depressing bit about it getting dark early

12/11/17, 11:39 AM - Hannah Guedenet: And I forgot to tell you. The girls are so excited about having pancakes for dinner tonight!!
12/11/17, 11:39 AM - Charles G: Also, definitely feel presence of syrian refugees here. I hear lots of Arabic. Someone at metro station was "singing" prayer out loud. In the US someone would have called the police
12/11/17, 11:40 AM - Charles G: Is this a thing now? When I'm gone, they get pancakes for dinner?
12/11/17, 11:41 AM - Charles G: :)

12/12/17, 6:27 AM - Hannah Guedenet: I'm at the cardiologist. Definitely youngest person in the waiting room. I feel like all of this is silly.
12/12/17, 6:29 AM - Hannah Guedenet: And I slept horribly. I heard a weird noise outside right before I went to bed and it freaked me out.
12/12/17, 6:31 AM - Charles G: It's probably nothing but you need to check. I'm glad you're going
12/12/17, 6:35 AM - Hannah Guedenet: I guess. Seems silly.
12/12/17, 6:35 AM - Hannah Guedenet: You done for the day?
12/12/17, 6:36 AM - Hannah Guedenet: I wish I could come to the office more. The front desk staff is lovely! So friendly and patient.

12/12/17, 7:07 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Oh gosh. That's a depressing way to spend your afternoon.
12/12/17, 7:07 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Maybe you should take a nap. And yes the staff at the cardiologist office
12/12/17, 7:09 AM - Charles G: Yeah. Good point. Maybe I'll look at monuments and then go to another Christmas market
12/12/17, 7:35 AM - Hannah Guedenet: So I'm getting a 24 hour heart monitor thing.
12/12/17, 8:16 AM - Charles G: Wow. That's going to be uncomfortable
12/12/17, 8:32 AM - Hannah Guedenet: It's not too bad. I need to wear a scarf to hide it.

12/18/17, 3:54 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Nutella knocks them off and it ruins our chairs.
12/18/17, 3:56 PM - Charles G: <Media omitted>
12/18/17, 4:00 PM - Hannah Guedenet: <Media omitted>
12/19/17, 4:55 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Well my morning keeps getting better. I was at the bus stop and looking down at my phone and a 16 bus just drove by!!! Then in trying to run after it, I missed a k6. Added to our communication problems, and this day is not going well
12/19/17, 5:36 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Also I got an email about the meeting in Seattle in Jan. Does it work ok for you if I'm in Seattle Jan 24? Would leave the 23 and be back the 26 I'm guessing.
12/19/17, 6:06 AM - Charles G: Sorry!!
12/19/17, 6:07 AM - Charles G: My day not going great either. I checked my email and our donor for Syria caught some errors in the survey data that are hard to explain

12/19/17, 6:13 AM - Hannah Guedenet: The consultants fault?
12/19/17, 6:14 AM - Hannah Guedenet: So I take it you're going to have to work...
12/19/17, 6:17 AM - Charles G: Everyone's fault, really. Survey software shouldn't have let it happen, consultant should have caught during quality control, and I should have caught it when reviewing report
12/19/17, 6:38 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Sorry bub. You have to straighten it out?
12/19/17, 6:45 AM - Charles G: Yes, l have to explain it or correct it. Our consultant is out for jury duty

1/18/18, 3:14 PM - Hannah Guedenet: <Media omitted>
1/18/18, 3:39 PM - Charles G: Oh man, again?? Are you collecting photo evidence now?
1/18/18, 3:39 PM - Charles G: Sorry, again. I need a sticky note reminder in the bathroom
1/18/18, 3:40 PM - Hannah Guedenet: This is my no nag approach
1/18/18, 3:40 PM - Hannah Guedenet: The interns are going to the store again...they have so much food that they haven't eaten!
1/18/18, 3:44 PM - Charles G: Yeah, weird. I don't think they know how to meal plan
1/18/18, 3:46 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Ha nope. Where are you?
1/18/18, 3:49 PM - Charles G: Getting on a lime bike
1/18/18, 3:52 PM - Charles G: Nevermind, a 16 bus pulled up so I'm on that. I would have needed to add my credit card info to use lime.
1/18/18, 4:09 PM - Charles G: I'm on New Hampshire
1/19/18, 2:50 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Cocktails at 6 pm. Be there or be square.
1/19/18, 2:50 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Also can you check on chickens again??
1/19/18, 3:08 PM - Charles G: 🕺
1/20/18, 11:30 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Damn we forgot the pomme d'Api again. Lil c started crying.
1/20/18, 11:31 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Ohhh they were selling chausson aux pommes
1/20/18, 11:34 AM - Charles G: Oh no. Poor c!
1/20/18, 11:34 AM - Charles G: Yeah, but they're so expensive
1/20/18, 2:04 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Not that bad. $3.50
1/20/18, 2:04 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Can you try and talk to your parents before we talk to aubin and Kozue?
1/20/18, 2:12 PM - Charles G: Ok
1/20/18, 2:13 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Leaving school. Saw Jennifer
1/20/18, 2:19 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Beltway is awful
1/21/18, 10:14 AM - Charles G: Where did you go??
1/22/18, 6:35 AM - Hannah Guedenet: You get a 🌟 for closing the shower curtain. When you have 5 🌟 you get a week of unlimited boob grabs. 😊
1/22/18, 6:36 AM - Charles G: Hahaha
1/22/18, 6:37 AM - Charles G: Today was the third in a row so only two more to go...!
1/22/18, 6:37 AM - Charles G: 😜
1/22/18, 6:38 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Umm...I get to give out the stars dude!!!
1/22/18, 6:40 AM - Charles G: Ooooook
1/22/18, 6:51 AM - Hannah Guedenet: I let the girls watch TV while I got ready. They were watching something where a fairy said she was kidnapped. Lil c goes "how was she kidnapped? She's not a kid??" 😃
1/22/18, 8:12 AM - Charles G: Haha! That's funny. Never thought about that
1/22/18, 1:42 PM - Hannah Guedenet: You alive??? Hope your day went ok.
1/22/18, 1:43 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Also a heads up I ran the dishwasher this AM. It was mostly full
1/22/18, 1:43 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Love you
1/22/18, 3:22 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Omg!! There was a ton of confusion at the pool and one of the teachers was a total bitch to the parents. Yelling at them. It was awful. And apparently she's teaching Addie's class. I'm not looking forward to it.
1/22/18, 3:22 PM - Hannah Guedenet: What time you headed home? (She asks hoping you're already headed home)
1/22/18, 3:23 PM - Hannah Guedenet: I went to the person who seems to be in charge and let him know how awful she was being. It was really just appalling.
1/22/18, 3:23 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Gigi seems lovely by comparison
1/22/18, 3:28 PM - Charles G: Hey. I'm at noma
1/22/18, 3:29 PM - Hannah Guedenet: I thought you were going to leave early?
1/22/18, 3:30 PM - Charles G: Sounds awful!!
1/22/18, 3:30 PM - Charles G: Who's Gigi?
1/22/18, 3:31 PM - Charles G: It can't be the same girl that was teaching last week. She was young and pretty soft spoken
1/22/18, 3:34 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Isn't that her teacher from last week? Seems they have now switched and Charlotte had the awful woman. I can see her talking to c and c shaking her head no. I'm so afraid she's going to terrify c.
1/22/18, 3:37 PM - Charles G: I don't remember her name. I can't see her being mean. It must be someone different
1/22/18, 3:39 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Yes it is. There are two women. The one from last week and this new awful woman
1/22/18, 3:39 PM - Hannah Guedenet: c started off with her old teacher then they switched because the parents in the other class were so pissed off they refused to let the horrible woman teach their kids.
1/22/18, 3:39 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Ugh. Ok class ending. Talk later.
1/22/18, 3:40 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Please start the Mac and cheese and sausages
1/22/18, 3:40 PM - Hannah Guedenet: You could do the sausages on the grill outside if you want. Less clean up
1/22/18, 3:41 PM - Charles G: Ok
1/22/18, 4:39 PM - Hannah Guedenet: On our way home
1/22/18, 4:43 PM - Charles G: Ok. Should I today brussel sprouts?
1/22/18, 4:43 PM - Charles G: Roast, not today
1/22/18, 4:51 PM - Charles G: Nevermind, steaming carrots
1/22/18, 4:53 PM - Hannah Guedenet: No I have zoodles!!!!
1/23/18, 4:45 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Spartans won (by a lot) in case you were worried. I love you much! Sorry for the morning craziness!!
1/23/18, 5:00 AM - Charles G: Oh, good!
1/23/18, 5:00 AM - Charles G: Have a good trip, babe. I love you
1/23/18, 5:01 AM - Hannah Guedenet: I'm also really sorry you'll have to do bedtime on your own. Was thinking about it. Think one mistake I made last night was that I started it off as a fight. We need to somehow make it fun. It just takes so much energy.
1/23/18, 5:06 AM - Charles G: Yeah, good point.
1/23/18, 5:07 AM - Charles G: I just want her to listen to me. It usually starts with pleading and encouragement but there's only so much you can say
1/23/18, 5:11 AM - Hannah Guedenet: I know. And then you just want to shake her! Well maybe that's just me...
1/23/18, 5:11 AM - Hannah Guedenet: I did pull the who is the boss card last night and that had some effect...short lived though
1/23/18, 5:11 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Almost on the Dulles toll road. Had a few slow spots but not awful
1/23/18, 5:11 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Char would love this guy's play list
1/23/18, 5:13 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Oh we should tell Char that Max died. Maybe she could make a card or drawing for Jack.
1/23/18, 5:17 AM - Hannah Guedenet: This guy is going 75 on the access road. We're flying!!
1/23/18, 5:39 AM - Charles G: I hope you don't get pulled over!
1/23/18, 5:40 AM - Charles G: <Media omitted>
1/23/18, 5:41 AM - Hannah Guedenet: I guess so nerd!
1/23/18, 5:41 AM - Hannah Guedenet: At airport and headed to gate. Love pre check!
1/23/18, 6:02 AM - Hannah Guedenet: That amazon store where you just walk out with stuff is just two blocks from my Airbnb!!
1/23/18, 6:02 AM - Charles G: C is going to kids adventure today, right?
1/23/18, 6:04 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Yes. There's a note in her bag
1/23/18, 6:05 AM - Charles G: K
1/23/18, 6:05 AM - Hannah Guedenet: And when you fill out the drop in form, just select having them bill us.
1/23/18, 6:05 AM - Hannah Guedenet: And Addie is set to stay until 6
1/23/18, 6:05 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Tuesday-Thursday
1/23/18, 6:06 AM - Hannah Guedenet: I copied you on all the emails
1/23/18, 6:06 AM - Hannah Guedenet: And I put a key under the mat for Wendy. Please leave it there
1/23/18, 6:12 AM - Charles G: Yep. Got it
1/23/18, 6:31 AM - Hannah Guedenet: On the plane. Seems pretty empty
1/23/18, 6:33 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Also just a quick note that c didn't have a homework packet in her folder yesterday. If she doesn't have one today, she needs to ask Ms Adeosun for one.
1/23/18, 6:44 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Several babies on the flight crying...
1/23/18, 6:44 AM - Hannah Guedenet: But I have an entire row to myself
1/23/18, 6:44 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Love you!! Have a good day!! 😘
1/23/18, 7:52 AM - Hannah Guedenet: So I apparently can message for free on the flight...in case you need anything.
1/23/18, 11:55 AM - Hannah Guedenet: How is your day going babe??
1/23/18, 12:43 PM - Hannah Guedenet: There's a child on the plane who is screaming like Addie does when she gets mad. It's awful.
1/23/18, 12:50 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Ahh man I didn't look at the weather. It's going to be nice enough that I could run outside but I didn't bring the right clothes.
1/23/18, 1:10 PM - Hannah Guedenet: I am in taxi. But you haven't read any of my 20 texts so I'm sure it doesn't matter...
1/23/18, 1:11 PM - Charles G: Hey
1/23/18, 1:12 PM - Charles G: Miss you on Skype!
1/23/18, 1:12 PM - Charles G: Sounds like a noisy flight!
1/23/18, 1:12 PM - Hannah Guedenet: But I'm on WhatsApp silly goose! 😊
1/23/18, 1:12 PM - Charles G: I can't type as fast on my phone
1/23/18, 1:12 PM - Hannah Guedenet: It was but I just felt for the parents (and it reminded me I really want bose noise cancelling headphones)
1/23/18, 1:14 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Oh I got an awesome email from someone at Gates about how well the Melinda visit went. She was really impressed by the work and apparently said when she got into the car "wow, now that is empowerment!"
1/23/18, 1:21 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Oh and ignore my message about the weather. That was the forecast for takoma park!!
1/23/18, 1:22 PM - Charles G: That's awesome babe. Se lever rocks!
1/23/18, 3:11 PM - Charles G: You should use that quote from Gates person in a blog post it other communication material
1/23/18, 3:12 PM - Charles G: On my way home. I hope girls did ok staying extra long at ka
1/23/18, 4:12 PM - Hannah Guedenet: We can talk later. Going for run on treadmill now
1/23/18, 4:57 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Only made it 2.5 miles. I hate treadmills
1/23/18, 6:30 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Thinking about you. Really hoping bedtime goes ok. I love you.
1/23/18, 6:55 PM - Charles G: Hey. So far, so good
1/23/18, 6:56 PM - Charles G: She went to bed, no cuddles, no whining
1/23/18, 9:07 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Oh my gosh!! The stinker!!
1/23/18, 9:10 PM - Charles G: I think she was traumatized from last night. She mumbled something about not doing it like last night.
1/23/18, 9:10 PM - Charles G: How's dinner going? I'm going to sleep in a few minutes
1/23/18, 9:18 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Just got back. It was interesting.
1/23/18, 9:18 PM - Hannah Guedenet: And part of me feels bad for her. But then again I don't. She'd been controlling bedtime. It was time she knew who was boss
1/23/18, 9:19 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Trying to decide if I should stay up...it's only 8:20 here but I'm exhausted.
1/23/18, 9:31 PM - Hannah Guedenet: I know you're asleep. Hope your day went well. I love u
1/24/18, 6:40 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Been up since 4:30
1/24/18, 6:40 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Oh well I went to bed before 9 so I guess it's ok
1/24/18, 6:43 AM - Hannah Guedenet: At some point let me know how your day went yesterday. My Airbnb doesn't have a coffee maker...
1/24/18, 6:48 AM - Charles G: Wow. You must be so tired!
1/24/18, 6:49 AM - Charles G: I'll email you an update soon. Walking to metro now
1/24/18, 6:49 AM - Hannah Guedenet: I mean I slept 8 hours
1/24/18, 6:49 AM - Hannah Guedenet: I have no idea how to respond to Malia.
1/24/18, 7:08 AM - Charles G: How did dinner go?
1/24/18, 7:09 AM - Hannah Guedenet: It went fine. The guys from world poultry are interesting. I can tell you more when we talk. They do not like AV
1/24/18, 7:09 AM - Charles G: Yeah, she makes it so hard to have a relationship. Just make it clear that the choice is hers. You're trying but it takes two to tango
1/24/18, 7:10 AM - Hannah Guedenet: They are a tiny org which surprises me that BMGF gave $20 million
1/24/18, 7:11 AM - Hannah Guedenet: And re: Malia. It's just exhausting. And somehow it's my fault. Am I wrong to think that you shouldn't "need" people? Like that just seems unhealthy. I love having you in my life but saying I need you in my life doesn't seem like a good thing does it?
1/24/18, 7:34 AM - Charles G: I want to be with people. Needing someone sends very transactional. As if you have a relationship with someone because they give you something in exchange. A healthy relationship needs to include something selflessness, in my opinion
1/24/18, 7:36 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Ok so my thinking isn't off
1/24/18, 7:37 AM - Charles G: No, I'm agreeing completely
1/24/18, 7:39 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Well google seems to disagree.
1/24/18, 7:40 AM - Hannah Guedenet: I just paid way too much for a coffee and scone. But the coffee place is a nonprofit that supports homeless kids and gives them apprenticeships. Pretty cool
1/24/18, 7:52 AM - Hannah Guedenet: And they're playing vampire weekend
1/24/18, 7:53 AM - Charles G: Cool. That's Seattle for you
1/24/18, 7:53 AM - Charles G: What did Google say??
1/24/18, 7:55 AM - Hannah Guedenet: https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/open-gently/201703/people-who-need-people-are-happier?amp
1/24/18, 8:00 AM - Charles G: Hmm...I see their point. Relationships are important. But there's a healthy need that's motivated by love and an unhealthy need that's motivated by insecurity, fear, anxiety
1/24/18, 8:03 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Yeah. There is a difference. And there is something in there about it being reciprocal
1/24/18, 3:19 PM - Charles G: How's your day going?
1/24/18, 3:20 PM - Charles G: Headed home now. I started my email update to you but didn't finish. I'll have to write more and send tonight
1/24/18, 3:35 PM - Hannah Guedenet: It's going. Very long day. But good. I love my job.
1/24/18, 3:35 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Are you going to get to the girls on time??? By 6??
1/24/18, 4:15 PM - Charles G: Yes, of course. I've been getting there about 15-20 min before 6
1/24/18, 4:18 PM - Hannah Guedenet: K
1/24/18, 5:12 PM - Charles G: <Media omitted>
1/24/18, 5:15 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Fun!!
1/24/18, 7:04 PM - Charles G: Another successful night with Addie 😁
1/24/18, 7:34 PM - Hannah Guedenet: I really am happy that it's easy for you. But she is so frustrating!!!
1/24/18, 7:35 PM - Hannah Guedenet: I'm still working...
1/24/18, 8:11 PM - Charles G: Still working? That's a bummer. Long day for you
1/24/18, 8:38 PM - Hannah Guedenet: At a dumplings place now having dinner. I miss you and wish I could hear about your day
1/24/18, 8:38 PM - Hannah Guedenet: I hope you're asleep and not reading this.
1/25/18, 7:58 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Morning babe. Slept a little later today and just now getting up. Going to meet with Seth in a bit and do some work. Gotta prep for tomorrow.
1/25/18, 7:58 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Shawn's mom has her surgery soon if you want to reach out.
1/25/18, 7:58 AM - Hannah Guedenet: I love you!!! Hope you had a good morning with the girls!!!
1/25/18, 8:03 AM - Hannah Guedenet: And this is totally random but I ran out of contact solution so I looked up if I could sleep in my contacts. Turns out that my type of lens is approved for 6 nights of continuous wear!! I had no idea!! I never have to take them out! (I will of course but it's a fun option)
1/25/18, 2:11 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Questions for you: was the house clean the other day?? Looked good??
1/25/18, 2:11 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Also is it tomorrow that you have your 2am call??
1/25/18, 2:11 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Hey you're online!!!😃
1/25/18, 2:46 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Hey call me when you can
1/25/18, 3:04 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Thought you'd enjoy this...
1/25/18, 3:04 PM - Hannah Guedenet: <Media omitted>
1/25/18, 3:13 PM - Charles G: Hey, I was in the quarterly review meeting from 12 until I left
1/25/18, 3:13 PM - Charles G: On metro now
1/25/18, 3:14 PM - Hannah Guedenet: You above ground?
1/25/18, 3:14 PM - Charles G: No
1/25/18, 3:15 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Call me when you are.
1/25/18, 3:15 PM - Charles G: Who were you texting with??
1/25/18, 3:15 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Sara Goldberg
1/25/18, 3:15 PM - Hannah Guedenet: About the interns
1/25/18, 3:15 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Need to talk to you about tomorrow. Shepard's mom invited c over for a play date tomorrow
1/25/18, 3:15 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Also just want to hear your voice...
1/25/18, 3:16 PM - Charles G: Oh, funny that they eat off the same plate!
1/25/18, 3:15 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Just had an amazing Korean lunch.
1/25/18, 3:17 PM - Charles G: Next is Union station
1/25/18, 3:17 PM - Hannah Guedenet: They're funny. Did Ali really come up just to chat with you the other night??
1/25/18, 3:19 PM - Charles G: I think. I don't know. I mean, he came and talked with me while I was fixing dinner.
1/25/18, 3:19 PM - Charles G: I didn't see them at all last night. They must have have out to eat
1/25/18, 3:19 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Hmmm that's cool
1/25/18, 3:20 PM - Charles G: He's worried about his job prospects. I was not super positive and a little distracted with dinner and girls
1/25/18, 3:21 PM - Charles G: Not a great conversation partner, unfortunately
1/25/18, 3:21 PM - Hannah Guedenet: I feel for him
1/25/18, 3:21 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Can I call?
1/25/18, 3:25 PM - Charles G: Yes, but I am still on the metro. Do you want to talk after I get off? I'm at Catholic University
1/25/18, 3:25 PM - Charles G: Brookland
1/25/18, 3:25 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Ok
1/25/18, 3:25 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Call me while you're walking. We need to figure out if you can change plan of taking c to KA tomorrow
1/25/18, 3:26 PM - Hannah Guedenet: And how it would work for her to do the play date
1/25/18, 3:29 PM - Charles G: I usually take a bike but will walk today. I have time
1/25/18, 3:29 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Or we can talk later
1/25/18, 3:31 PM - Charles G: I would like to talk now, if you can
1/25/18, 3:31 PM - Hannah Guedenet: K
1/25/18, 6:03 PM - Charles G: <Media omitted>
1/25/18, 6:03 PM - Charles G: Excuse the typos
1/25/18, 6:22 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Ahhh love it!
1/25/18, 6:23 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Found a French bakery that had great looking tartes. Taking them to Molly and Scott's for dinner.
1/25/18, 6:32 PM - Hannah Guedenet: And I got on headed the wrong way on the light rail...
1/25/18, 6:32 PM - Hannah Guedenet: I even asked someone and he told me which side of the platform I needed to be on...
1/25/18, 6:34 PM - Charles G: They gave you the wrong info?
1/25/18, 6:35 PM - Charles G: 👍 on the French bakery
1/25/18, 6:35 PM - Hannah Guedenet: I guess so or I missed something
1/25/18, 6:36 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Think I'll go back there tomorrow AM for coffee and chausson aux pommes
1/25/18, 6:42 PM - Charles G: Living it up
1/25/18, 6:42 PM - Hannah Guedenet: “It’s very likely that the universe is really a kind of a question, rather than the answer to anything,” says philosopher technologist Kevin Kelly. He was the founding editor of WIRED and is an original thinker on shaping the character and spiritual meaning of technology. He says our role as good askers of questions will remain the most important contribution of our species in a coming world of AI.

1/26/18, 4:29 PM - Hannah Guedenet: I'm on the plane. The last couple of days have been really good. I love my job, hun. After 10 years of working, I've finally found what I'm good at and enjoy. The foundation loves ASI which is a little terrifying but they're really excited about the TA mechanism. The next few years are going to be intense...
1/26/18, 4:32 PM - Charles G: What about all the rain over there?
1/26/18, 4:32 PM - Charles G: That's as great reflection

2/17/18, 4:17 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Aubin is lusting over your bonsai
2/17/18, 4:29 PM - Charles G: Oh yeah? Ha! His bonsai are much cooler than mine, to be honest. He actually experiments with pruning and wiring
2/17/18, 4:31 PM - Hannah Guedenet: He said you do a better job
2/17/18, 4:31 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Still on the ground???
2/17/18, 4:37 PM - Charles G: Yep. Still on the ground. We're in line. They're pretty backed up
2/17/18, 4:38 PM - Charles G: They're offering to let us get off the airplane. Apparently they have to by law
2/17/18, 4:51 PM - Charles G: Shoot, we're ready to go but people got off so now they have Chase them down. Argh!!
2/17/18, 4:53 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Omg!!

2/17/18, 6:07 PM - Charles G: Hey, still in the plane. They ran out of de-icing and it's taking them forever to come back with more
2/17/18, 6:07 PM - Charles G: I've been on this plane for 3 hours
2/17/18, 6:09 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Omg. I'm so sorry babw
2/17/18, 6:09 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Babe
2/17/18, 6:09 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Missed voice call
2/17/18, 6:13 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Missed voice call
2/17/18, 6:28 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Think Airbnb could be expensive in the winter. They said it's cold down there
2/17/18, 6:30 PM - Charles G: Yeah, saw that. I don't think we have too many more cold nights ahead of us
2/17/18, 6:31 PM - Hannah Guedenet: I also bought aubin some beer for his work on the coop today
2/17/18, 6:32 PM - Charles G: That was nice
2/17/18, 7:50 PM - Hannah Guedenet: The Airbnb guests are really loud.
2/17/18, 8:02 PM - Hannah Guedenet: And we're screwed. Our daycare account is going to be taken out and we don't have enough money in the account. And discover is doing some maintenance so you can't transfer money...
2/18/18, 2:59 AM - Charles G: Hey. In Munich and on my next plane
2/18/18, 3:00 AM - Charles G: When is it going to be taken account? Maybe we should pay for overdraft protection. I feel like this happens every year
2/18/18, 3:00 AM - Charles G: Taken out, not taken account
2/18/18, 6:44 AM - Hannah Guedenet: I think we have some protection. I think we might be ok. I had taken out cash for my trip that I'm going to put back in. And Icdeposited the check from my parents.
2/18/18, 7:06 AM - Hannah Guedenet: I've gotta figure out a different attitude. The girls are driving me crazy. There is just so much drama. All the time
2/18/18, 7:07 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Please be safe I love you.
2/18/18, 8:05 AM - Charles G: Landed in telaviv
2/18/18, 8:21 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Again be safe
2/18/18, 8:59 AM - Charles G: I'm at the hotel now. Beautiful landscape and short ride from airport. Looks like project file does work here
2/18/18, 9:48 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Good to hear. Miss you.
2/18/18, 9:48 AM - Hannah Guedenet: What time is it there?
2/18/18, 11:19 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Do you wanna say hi to the girls before nap?
2/18/18, 12:53 PM - Charles G: Shoot. I missed nap time. There's a 7 hours difference
2/18/18, 12:54 PM - Charles G: Had some wonderful Palestinian food and then wine. Going to bed soon. Want to talk?
2/18/18, 1:19 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Sounds great!!
2/18/18, 1:19 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Just got up from a nap.
2/18/18, 1:20 PM - Hannah Guedenet: In case I haven't told you lately, you're an amazing father. This whole solo parenting thing SUCKS!!

2/19/18, 9:09 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Omg! Aubin let the chickens out and then a hawk swooped over their yard!!! It was crazy!!
2/19/18, 9:12 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Also I made delicious biscotti!

2/20/18, 12:01 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Omg... Baklava!! I assume you know what you can bring back for me...
2/20/18, 12:03 AM - Hannah Guedenet: I can't sleep either but it's not because of a book (that sounds awful btw). Having that pain in my hip. Plus I kept dreaming about writing website content for the Olympics (guess what I did before bedtime). Hopefully not I can go back to sleep. Love you
2/20/18, 2:25 AM - Charles G: Hope you slept better. I'm actually doing ok on 3-4 hours of sleep. I led a theory of change exercise which is always challenging but I think it was useful for everyone. We're on a break and everyone has disappeared...not good
2/20/18, 7:40 AM - Charles G: On my way back to hotel for a little work before heading to dinner
2/20/18, 8:03 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Thanks for the update. Just a note that baklava makes me happier than most things in this world.
2/20/18, 8:09 AM - Charles G: Haha...duly noted. I wanted to get some yesterday but they said to wait until tomorrow so that it's fresher.
2/20/18, 8:10 AM - Charles G: <Media omitted>
2/20/18, 8:10 AM - Charles G: Here's a video for Charlotte and addie
2/20/18, 8:10 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Fresh is best
2/20/18, 8:10 AM - Charles G: I'm tired so my French is a little off at times
2/20/18, 8:16 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Omg the cleaning crew is here. There are 5 of them!!
2/20/18, 8:17 AM - Charles G: Wow!!
2/20/18, 8:19 AM - Hannah Guedenet: I'm just going to hide in the office...
2/20/18, 8:19 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Also did I tell you the crazy work around I did for bank of America??
2/20/18, 8:22 AM - Charles G: Yeah, you said in an audio message. Impressive!
2/20/18, 9:01 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Hey did you see my email about the wedding in St Louis?
2/20/18, 9:10 AM - Hannah Guedenet: And they were done in less than an hour...wow
2/20/18, 9:26 AM - Charles G: Yeah, I saw. Seems crazy to add another trip given how crazy Feb thru may is but it is short.
2/20/18, 9:40 AM - Charles G: Weddings are special too. You should go if we can afford it
2/20/18, 9:46 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Well considering my hotel would basically be free and I can get a flight with points, seems like it should be affordable.
2/20/18, 9:52 AM - Charles G: Ok
2/20/18, 9:53 AM - Charles G: Off to dinner now! Love you!
2/20/18, 9:54 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Love you too

2/20/18, 1:09 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Ha
2/20/18, 9:23 PM - Hannah Guedenet: So I'm still up...
2/20/18, 9:23 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Working on the proposal.
2/20/18, 9:24 PM - Hannah Guedenet: And of course word just shut down in me.
2/20/18, 10:00 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Ok sent it off to Ana. I'm sure she'll have tons of edits. It still needs quite a bit of work. But I think I at least addressed all the Gates comments.
2/20/18, 10:01 PM - Hannah Guedenet: I had things I wanted to tell you but I'm so tired. Girls are doing fine. They loved your video. Addie kept trying to talk to it and tell you things. I made pasta tonight so I could sit with her and play for a little bit which she loved. She just wants your attention.
2/20/18, 10:02 PM - Charles G: Hey, thanks for updates. U just woke up

2/21/18, 12:42 PM - Charles G: Hey, I'm back.
2/21/18, 12:44 PM - Charles G: Nice Little field trip. It still feels so strange to be in Palestine. Ive learned so much about this place.
2/21/18, 12:44 PM - Hannah Guedenet: So cool!! Can't wait to hear about it.
2/21/18, 12:46 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Question for you. Do you have any more info on your Uganda dates?
2/21/18, 12:51 PM - Charles G: Let me check my email

2/21/18, 1:37 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Feeling a bit stressed. But I made dinner this morning so that's one thing I don't have to worry about.
2/21/18, 1:38 PM - Charles G: Wow, so you're transitioning from the proposal to a webinar and then to your work planning workshop. Sounds exhausting
2/21/18, 1:39 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Then when I'm back I have to develop a client assessment tool then travel to Nigeria and test it!!
2/21/18, 1:39 PM - Charles G: Holy smokes.

2/22/18, 2:17 PM - Hannah Guedenet: You exhausted?
2/22/18, 2:22 PM - Charles G: Yeah, pretty tired but will be ok. The flight was smooth.
2/22/18, 2:44 PM - Hannah Guedenet: How's traffic??
2/22/18, 2:44 PM - Charles G: Awful. Very very slow
2/22/18, 2:46 PM - Hannah Guedenet: As expected d
2/22/18, 2:50 PM - Charles G: GPS is saying 55 minutes. I won't be able to pick up girls :(
2/22/18, 2:54 PM - Charles G: You apparently rocked the webinar this morning 👍😁
2/22/18, 2:54 PM - Charles G: Samiha texted saying that you were in fire
2/22/18, 2:54 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Wasn't thinking you would pick up the girls.
2/22/18, 2:54 PM - Hannah Guedenet: I will leave in about 15 mins
2/22/18, 2:54 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Sorry about traffic
2/22/18, 2:55 PM - Hannah Guedenet: And samiha is a nerd but yes it went really well. Shockingly well
2/22/18, 3:02 PM - Hannah Guedenet: I have a sore throat
2/22/18, 3:23 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Omg just got on a metro car that reeks of pot!!
2/22/18, 3:24 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Also I told the girls you wouldn't be home until after dinner (wanted to manage expectations in case you were delayed). They'll be SO excited when you surprise them.
2/22/18, 3:27 PM - Charles G: My coat stinks of cigarette smoke. Everyone smokes in Ramallah and restaurants were just awful (for smoke, not food)
2/22/18, 3:27 PM - Charles G: Thanks for managing expectations
2/22/18, 3:27 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Ugh. That's the worst
2/22/18, 3:28 PM - Charles G: I need to bring it to dry cleaners
2/22/18, 3:30 PM - Hannah Guedenet: It is so expensive. To bad you can't expense it. ;)

2/23/18, 2:02 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Traffic wasn't bad and Malik drove agressively but not recklessly
2/23/18, 2:17 PM - Hannah Guedenet: I forgot a few things. My pillow for the plane and some flip flops. Oh well
2/23/18, 3:10 PM - Charles G: Just went for a run. I think I may try to run while at work and/or do some yoga in the mornings
2/23/18, 3:11 PM - Charles G: Yay for precheck!
2/23/18, 3:26 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Glad you got in a run. Where will run at work?

2/24/18, 12:13 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Or bring c home I mean
2/24/18, 12:13 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Might be easier than Kozue since she knows where the classroom is and all
2/24/18, 12:14 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Don't forget to have her do her homework!!
2/24/18, 12:17 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Also that was a horrible flight. The kid behind me cried almost the entire flight. The cabin crew was awful. It was super hot. All around baf

2/24/18, 7:58 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Yes
2/24/18, 7:59 AM - Hannah Guedenet: She could take it with her to KA. Not that they could help her but if we explained ahead of time what she needs to do, maybe she could do it
2/24/18, 7:59 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Ok on the plane. Love you
2/24/18, 7:59 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Xoxox

2/24/18, 8:25 AM - Hannah Guedenet: I mean she's such a pro in English it makes sense the French would come too!!
2/24/18, 8:25 AM - Hannah Guedenet: I can't wait to have her read to me when I'm home. I'll see if there are some easy reader books in the airport I can get her
2/24/18, 8:27 AM - Hannah Guedenet: We are still sitting in Paris...
2/24/18, 8:32 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Finally leaving...I think. I'm in a bad mood. I don't want to be on this trip. I just want to be home...
2/24/18, 8:56 AM - Charles G: Girls and took showers. They're now playing together downstairs
2/24/18, 8:56 AM - Charles G: I'm dreading my trip in May. It's going to be a long one

2/25/18, 1:33 PM - Charles G: Yay.
2/25/18, 1:33 PM - Hannah Guedenet: I need to eat something but maybe we can talk later
2/25/18, 1:33 PM - Charles G: Thanks for the update

2/25/18, 4:17 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Missed voice call
2/25/18, 4:30 PM - Hannah Guedenet: I found an Ambien in my toiletries bag. Taking it!!!
2/25/18, 4:31 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Glad you've had a good day with the girls. I miss y'all. I'm frustrated because I don't know why I'm here. They seem to have everything under control so it's just going to be a week of me sitting... I wish I had stayed home.
2/25/18, 4:31 PM - Hannah Guedenet: I love you b
2/25/18, 4:33 PM - Charles G: Yay for the Ambien. I'm sure you'll make the most of your stay. Love you
2/25/18, 4:34 PM - Charles G: <Media omitted>
2/25/18, 4:35 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Yes. There are some more in one of the plastic things
2/25/18, 4:35 PM - Hannah Guedenet: We need to get more Ambien before either of us travels
2/25/18, 4:35 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Are y'all eating ok??
2/25/18, 4:35 PM - Charles G: Ok. Thanks. 2 to 1 ratio for water?
2/25/18, 4:35 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Also I emailed you the soccer form to mail in for Addie.
2/25/18, 4:36 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Yes. Maybe a tad bit more water near the end
2/25/18, 4:36 PM - Hannah Guedenet: I really want a ntyimes subscription...
2/25/18, 4:36 PM - Charles G: Yeah, eating great. I made a yummy smoothie today
2/25/18, 4:36 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Yum!!
2/25/18, 4:38 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Ok going to sleep. Love you
2/25/18, 4:45 PM - Charles G: Sleep well
2/26/18, 5:39 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Morning babe. Slept well. Love Ambien (plus I was exhausted). Got up and ran this AM but only made 3km because there was no AC or fan in the gym. Ugh. Morning has started off well.
2/26/18, 5:39 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Hope you have a great day. Love you!!!
2/26/18, 5:44 AM - Charles G: Hey. Meant to get work done this morning but girls woke up at 7am...ugh
2/26/18, 5:47 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Sorry babe. You going to the office?
2/26/18, 5:48 AM - Hannah Guedenet: And they have been waking up early lately.
2/26/18, 5:52 AM - Charles G: Not sure. I was planning to but think maybe not
2/26/18, 6:09 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Did you do your travel expenses stuff?
2/26/18, 6:21 AM - Charles G: No
2/26/18, 6:21 AM - Charles G: Why?
2/26/18, 7:19 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Because it seems to take ages. Did we ever get the Berlin one???
2/26/18, 7:34 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Yeah I just checked. We never got it.
2/26/18, 7:35 AM - Hannah Guedenet: But we already paid the credit card so we're out the cash
2/26/18, 9:46 AM - Hannah Guedenet: I have monkey butt
2/26/18, 9:46 AM - Charles G: Huh?
2/26/18, 9:49 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Weren't you going to get me something for monkey butt? I've been sitting all day and it's hot
2/26/18, 10:08 AM - Charles G: Oh, that!! Sorry. I should have gotten you there anti-monkey butt paste.
2/26/18, 10:10 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Yes!! 😁
2/26/18, 10:10 AM - Hannah Guedenet: You doing ok?
2/26/18, 12:04 PM - Charles G: Feeling overwhelmed. Need to prioritize
2/26/18, 12:04 PM - Charles G: How'd your first day go?
2/26/18, 12:09 PM - Hannah Guedenet: It was ok. We had a very long debriefing at the end that was a little tense at times. I'm glad to be done with the day
2/26/18, 12:25 PM - Charles G: Is the venue nice at least?
2/26/18, 12:26 PM - Hannah Guedenet: It is. Pretty comfortable for Burkina
2/26/18, 1:01 PM - Hannah Guedenet: I have a horrible heat rash between my legs from my run this morning. It's bad
2/26/18, 1:02 PM - Charles G: Did you bring the roller that you bought? Sorry babe
2/26/18, 1:03 PM - Hannah Guedenet: I did. Then forgot to put it on before my run
2/26/18, 1:07 PM - Hannah Guedenet: I am so tired. Hoping I can make it to 9
2/26/18, 1:40 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Did Addie wear wacky socks today? Tomorrow she's supposed to wear green
2/26/18, 1:41 PM - Hannah Guedenet: I forwarded you the email with the info about dr Seuss week
2/26/18, 1:43 PM - Charles G: I know. I got the email too. She didn't want wacky socks so I didn't force her
2/26/18, 1:45 PM - Hannah Guedenet: That girl
2/26/18, 1:47 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Soooo...a year subscription of NY times costs $130. That's a little over $10 a month. I'm going forward.
2/26/18, 1:48 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Speak now or forever hold your peace...
2/26/18, 1:48 PM - Charles G: What??
2/26/18, 1:48 PM - Hannah Guedenet: What what??
2/26/18, 1:48 PM - Charles G: Just delete your cookies when you reach your max for the month
2/26/18, 1:48 PM - Hannah Guedenet: No!! It doesn't work on the app
2/26/18, 1:49 PM - Hannah Guedenet: And it uses a lot of data
2/26/18, 1:49 PM - Hannah Guedenet: And I want to support journalism
2/26/18, 1:51 PM - Charles G: We should support WP paper then.
2/26/18, 1:51 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Why?
2/26/18, 1:51 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Their reporting kind of sucks
2/26/18, 1:52 PM - Charles G: We get serious discount if we get Sunday paper delivered. Just $40/yr
2/26/18, 1:52 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Hmmmm
2/26/18, 1:52 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Guess we can discuss when I'm home.
2/26/18, 1:52 PM - Charles G: It's somehow cheaper than just getting digital
2/26/18, 1:52 PM - Hannah Guedenet: That's weird
2/26/18, 1:53 PM - Hannah Guedenet: How do you know this?
2/26/18, 1:54 PM - Charles G: It probably has to do with advertising. They want to say they deliver x number of papers every day or week.
2/26/18, 1:54 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Ahh you're so smart
2/26/18, 1:55 PM - Charles G: Only works if you're in DC metro area, of course
2/26/18, 1:55 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Right
2/26/18, 1:55 PM - Charles G: The different deals are all on their website
2/26/18, 2:01 PM - Hannah Guedenet: K
2/26/18, 2:02 PM - Hannah Guedenet: It's 9. I'm going to bed
2/26/18, 2:02 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Love you. Huge hugs to the girls!!!
2/26/18, 2:02 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Xoxo
2/26/18, 2:03 PM - Charles G: Ok. Sleep well! Love you
2/26/18, 2:03 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Good luck getting a grasp on things and prioritizing!
2/26/18, 2:04 PM - Charles G: Yeah, thanks. Doing my best
2/27/18, 6:45 AM - Charles G: Hey there. How your day is going well. Girls woke up at 6:45 this morning. I was very annoyed. So much for morning yoga and meditation
2/27/18, 7:46 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Hey I'm alive. Just have no connection
2/27/18, 7:46 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Sorry babe. You should tell them to stay in bed!
2/27/18, 7:47 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Morning didn't start off well here. Ended up in an argument with the gender lead for ASI. Long story.
2/27/18, 7:47 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Plus the presentations are much more boring. Not as good as yesterday.
2/27/18, 7:49 AM - Hannah Guedenet: I tried sending video but connection is awful
2/27/18, 7:56 AM - Hannah Guedenet: And I'm bloated
2/27/18, 7:56 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Just generally grumpy
2/27/18, 7:58 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Not sure I'm getting all the texts. Are y'all going over to the neighbors for dinner?
2/27/18, 7:58 AM - Hannah Guedenet: <Media omitted>
2/27/18, 8:08 AM - Charles G: Hey there
2/27/18, 8:09 AM - Charles G: Sorry you had a long day. Arguing in French must be tiring
2/27/18, 8:09 AM - Charles G: Or really any language.
2/27/18, 8:09 AM - Charles G: Yeah, going to Justin and Julie's tonight, I think
2/27/18, 8:09 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Well that message was sent to aubin ans Kozue
2/27/18, 8:09 AM - Hannah Guedenet: And
2/27/18, 8:10 AM - Hannah Guedenet: And yes it's not the way I wanted to start my day.
2/27/18, 8:10 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Sadly it is only 3 here so we still have a long afternoon ahead of us...
2/27/18, 8:10 AM - Charles G: Yikes
2/27/18, 8:10 AM - Charles G: Oh crap
2/27/18, 8:10 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Yikes what?
2/27/18, 8:12 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Is your trip to Uganda confirmed?
2/27/18, 8:12 AM - Hannah Guedenet: And sorry your morning didn't start out well
2/27/18, 9:33 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Just a heads that the hungry harvest box looks like a good one this week. Had apples and oranges and broccoli
2/27/18, 2:12 PM - Hannah Guedenet: You doing ok??
2/27/18, 3:09 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Going to bed. I miss you. And the girls.
2/27/18, 3:22 PM - Charles G: Ok
2/27/18, 3:23 PM - Charles G: Good day overall. Miss you too. Sleep well
2/28/18, 7:24 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Did your morning go ok?
2/28/18, 8:20 AM - Charles G: Yeah, fine. Addie was a little difficult but not terrible
2/28/18, 8:20 AM - Charles G: How's your day going?
2/28/18, 8:21 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Good!!
2/28/18, 8:22 AM - Hannah Guedenet: You at office or working from home?
2/28/18, 8:23 AM - Charles G: At the office. Sari took c to bus stop
2/28/18, 8:27 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Cool. Hope you have a good day.
2/28/18, 8:27 AM - Hannah Guedenet: My head keeps spinning about how crazy the next few months will be...
2/28/18, 8:28 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Seems we should be doing that lent challenge about simplifying life. Should we forget about soccer for Addie? It just seems unnecessary. We can just say that some family stuff has come up and we can't do it.
2/28/18, 8:56 AM - Hannah Guedenet: The m&e session est chaud!! People are very passionate about collecting data...
2/28/18, 9:16 AM - Charles G: Cool!! My kind of people :)
2/28/18, 9:43 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Did you see my message about soccer???
2/28/18, 9:43 AM - Charles G: Yeah, I think you might be right
2/28/18, 9:44 AM - Charles G: With you and me both out, I just don't know how we would make it work
2/28/18, 9:45 AM - Charles G: We could still sign up but not coach. If we go to a few practices, worth it?
2/28/18, 9:46 AM - Hannah Guedenet: What do we do?
2/28/18, 9:47 AM - Hannah Guedenet: She does soccer shots at school
2/28/18, 9:48 AM - Hannah Guedenet: It's just another thing we'd have to figure into our schedule...
2/28/18, 9:55 AM - Charles G: True. I'll cancel. It's just easier
2/28/18, 9:55 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Sorry. This is my fault
2/28/18, 9:55 AM - Charles G: I just spent all morning taking care of my travel reimbursement
2/28/18, 9:55 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Sorry.
2/28/18, 9:55 AM - Charles G: $146/day m&ie
2/28/18, 9:56 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Did you look into the Berlin onrMm
2/28/18, 9:56 AM - Hannah Guedenet: One??
2/28/18, 9:56 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Damn!
2/28/18, 9:56 AM - Hannah Guedenet: That's what it is for Lagos
2/28/18, 9:56 AM - Charles G: Yeah, apparently u gave to get division approval again because I had been missing a supporting document so it was originally rejected by finance
2/28/18, 9:57 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Ugh
2/28/18, 9:57 AM - Charles G: But they didn't tell me until email and asked where my payment was...argh
2/28/18, 9:57 AM - Hannah Guedenet: I have to say I'm not a fan of the irex system...
2/28/18, 10:11 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Btw I emailed you my dates for Nigeria. But looks like I might leave on Monday. Flights are crazy and I'm not getting there super early or spending tons of money just to arrive for a meeting on Tuesday night.
2/28/18, 10:22 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Ugh we arent seeing all the changes we had hoped for...
2/28/18, 10:24 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Like only 10% of households have improved poultry houses. The target is 75%. We started at 4%
2/28/18, 12:08 PM - Charles G: Maybe the target was unrealistic?
2/28/18, 12:14 PM - Charles G: I've got dates for my moz trip:9-18. I will only miss one weekend
2/28/18, 12:21 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Ok. Good to know. I'll let the folks know about Tanzania. Means I won't be able to go
2/28/18, 12:49 PM - Charles G: What are your Tanzania dates?
2/28/18, 12:50 PM - Charles G: Also, I didn't see an email with your Nigeria dates. Are you sure you sent them?
2/28/18, 1:03 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Sent it in response to your another day... Email
2/28/18, 1:14 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Leave Monday the 19. And I'm back Saturday evening the 24
2/28/18, 1:14 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Need to talk to your parents
2/28/18, 2:47 PM - Hannah Guedenet: You around? I'd love to hear your voice before going to bed
2/28/18, 2:47 PM - Hannah Guedenet: I miss you
2/28/18, 2:51 PM - Hannah Guedenet: A lot
2/28/18, 2:54 PM - Charles G: Hey, going to head out soon. What to talk now?
3/1/18, 4:41 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Morning sexy mab

3/19/18, 1:01 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Ladd sent me a lounge pass. I think I'll check it out.
3/19/18, 1:07 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Now we're talking about voodoo
3/19/18, 1:09 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Omg...apparently a wife had an affair and her boyfriend got stuck inside her!
3/19/18, 1:10 PM - Charles G: Hahaha
3/19/18, 1:11 PM - Hannah Guedenet: I wasn't sure at first what he meant when he said he got stuck in her
3/19/18, 1:17 PM - Charles G: Do you still have those newspaper clippings from Zimbabwe?
3/19/18, 1:17 PM - Charles G: You know what I'm talking about? There were some crazy stories
3/19/18, 1:18 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Yep
3/19/18, 1:18 PM - Hannah Guedenet: It's actually sad. He has a friend who died in Sierra leone. He said it was voodoo
3/19/18, 1:19 PM - Hannah Guedenet: They're in a folder in the office
3/19/18, 1:21 PM - Charles G: Oh, that is sad
3/19/18, 1:22 PM - Charles G: By the way, please ask if he would be available Thursday evening to drive me to airport
3/19/18, 1:28 PM - Hannah Guedenet: I told him you'd call him. I didn't know your flight info
3/19/18, 1:29 PM - Charles G: Ok. Thanks
3/19/18, 1:43 PM - Hannah Guedenet: I brought your black suitcase as a carry on. It feels a little big
3/19/18, 1:46 PM - Charles G: It'll pass
3/19/18, 1:47 PM - Charles G: Ok. Getting ready to leave now
3/19/18, 1:57 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Fingers crossed. No luck with the lounge pass. Only works for United lounges and they're in a different temrjnal. Oh well
3/19/18, 2:02 PM - Charles G: Bummer
3/19/18, 2:02 PM - Hannah Guedenet: I mean I have an hour. I could go over there but I found an &pizza with beer and pizza

3/19/18, 2:40 PM - Hannah Guedenet: You could text aubin and see if he could grab her...
3/19/18, 2:40 PM - Hannah Guedenet: He might already be gone though
3/19/18, 2:50 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Omg my dad just told me about how I should be prepared to be taken to a little room at customs in Nigeria where they will try to get money from me...
3/19/18, 2:50 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Like he did when he was there...over 30 years ago!!!
3/19/18, 2:51 PM - Hannah Guedenet: I know he's just trying to relate to my work and feel a connection. But it still drives me a little nuts.
3/19/18, 2:52 PM - Charles G: Turning onto Maple
3/19/18, 2:53 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Nice work babe!!
3/19/18, 3:08 PM - Charles G: Made it. She was the last one

3/19/18, 3:16 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Ons
3/19/18, 3:16 PM - Hannah Guedenet: A guy got pulled with a bag smaller than mine.
3/19/18, 3:26 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Dammit! They made me check it. Seems like it is just random because other people aren't having theirs checked.
3/19/18, 3:26 PM - Hannah Guedenet: I'm pissed
3/19/18, 3:27 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Also question for you -- do you have a social networking analysis software you would recommend
3/19/18, 3:29 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Apparently I need a smaller carry on. Currently not a fan of Lufthansa
3/19/18, 3:31 PM - Charles G: Sorry!!
3/19/18, 3:31 PM - Charles G: I recommend gephi
3/19/18, 3:32 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Ok cool. Is it free?

3/23/18, 4:35 AM - Hannah Guedenet: It was the message right before your message
3/23/18, 4:38 AM - Charles G: Apparently Nina, my co-worker, had 2 laptops. I have no idea why
3/23/18, 4:38 AM - Hannah Guedenet: So you can use the 2nd one??
3/23/18, 4:41 AM - Charles G: Yep

3/23/18, 3:19 PM - Hannah Guedenet: And I have diarrhea
3/23/18, 3:19 PM - Charles G: Oh man. Sounds awful. I'm sorry!
3/23/18, 3:20 PM - Charles G: I'm in a quiet room. They have mine chairs. Guess I'll try to sleep here before my next flight in 6 hours

3/23/18, 3:21 PM - Hannah Guedenet: I can't believe what a crazy flight you have...
3/23/18, 3:22 PM - Charles G: Yeah, never again. Not just because it's tiring. It's also a waste. It's not like I'm working
3/23/18, 3:24 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Agreed
3/23/18, 3:25 PM - Charles G: So much for a quiet room. Someone is playing a soccer game on their phone
3/23/18, 3:26 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Say something!!
3/23/18, 3:27 PM - Charles G: Too tired... Anyways, it's off now. He may have seen me staring

3/23/18, 3:31 PM - Charles G: I'm becoming more sentimental in my middle age
3/23/18, 3:47 PM - Hannah Guedenet: I think I might throw up...
3/23/18, 3:47 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Not about you crying...
3/23/18, 5:14 PM - Hannah Guedenet: And now I've thrown up...hopefully that will help.

3/27/18, 6:26 AM - Hannah Guedenet: I don't understand your mom. She is always saying she wants to help. So this morning I brought down the girls basket of clothes and asked if she could wash it. Her response: bon mais j'ai fait tout le linge il y a 3 jours!
3/27/18, 6:26 AM - Hannah Guedenet: What am I supposed to do with that?
3/27/18, 6:27 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Your dad took me to the metro today. He asked about Malia. It was just kind of awkward because he was like "she is so sympathique" i dont know how to explain how messed up she is

3/30/18, 3:00 PM - Charles G: Yes, please get the Peugeot. Same itinerary going back but layover in Doha is much shorter. Also, seems I packed my phone charger in my suitcase. Argh!!!

4/8/18, 7:31 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Missed voice call
4/9/18, 7:21 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Couple of things I thought of. 1) you asked about new budget categories. We need a new one for garden/house/bonsai stuff. Your trips to home Depot and Ace. No problem with you spending money but we need to set some goals and track to better. 2) I looked it up and purple heart does take computer monitors. We need to organize that stuff tonight
4/9/18, 12:51 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Also we're all set for you to take c to Coda's tomorrow am
4/9/18, 3:02 PM - Charles G: We have a category for improvement
4/9/18, 3:02 PM - Charles G: Let's discuss tonight
4/9/18, 3:26 PM - Hannah Guedenet: But right now it also has the $400 for the HVAC. Not really useful in its current form
4/9/18, 3:28 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Not sure it will happen tonight.
4/9/18, 3:28 PM - Hannah Guedenet: You asked for categories. I have you one that doesn't currently have a budget and isn't being tracked
4/9/18, 3:28 PM - Hannah Guedenet: We can talk once I've done mint for March
4/9/18, 3:29 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Hey would it work for me to export the march data to excel and edit there. It would be easier since I don't love doing it in mint.
4/9/18, 3:29 PM - Hannah Guedenet: ?
4/9/18, 3:36 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Leaving now. Will y'all pick me up?
4/9/18, 3:44 PM - Charles G: Yep. Just now leaving school
4/9/18, 3:45 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Oh I'm just now getting on a train. Never mind. I'll take a bus home. Don't want y'all to have to wait
4/9/18, 3:45 PM - Hannah Guedenet: You got out of there faster than I do
4/9/18, 3:51 PM - Charles G: It's ok. We can wait. Just put on podcast
4/9/18, 3:52 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Ok thanks. Sorry. I'm at brookland so should be there soon
4/9/18, 3:53 PM - Hannah Guedenet: The lady next to me on the metro is typing on her phone with only one hand. That would take ages!!! Doesn't she realize that is why God gave us two hands?!?!
4/9/18, 3:56 PM - Charles G: I use one hand but swipe. I make more errors with two hands
4/9/18, 3:57 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Huh
4/9/18, 3:57 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Y'all in the parking lot??
4/10/18, 4:07 PM - Charles G: Waiting for bus

4/11/18, 6:22 AM - Charles G: Hey, thanks for moving your meeting and taking the girls this morning. Have a good trip. I love you very much.
4/11/18, 7:23 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Thankfully the person was flexible and could move it. Hope the training goes well but not sure you need it.
4/11/18, 7:24 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Also I was wrong about Hayley and Kelly not hiking. I texted Hayley to see if they wanted the hiking backpack. She responded Yes immediately. Told her to stop by some evening and pick it up.
4/11/18, 7:24 AM - Hannah Guedenet: High five to us and our successful cleaning out of stuff!!
4/11/18, 8:40 AM - Charles G: Awesome. I'm glad it's going to someone we know
4/11/18, 8:52 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Paul Ryan isn't seeking re election??????
4/11/18, 8:52 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Did you see that???
4/11/18, 11:23 AM - Charles G: Crazy. Can't blame him. Working with Trump must be awful and politicians have higher tolerance for difficult people than most

4/11/18, 11:47 AM - Hannah Guedenet: No I need to get the car washed and head out. Your mom just got here
4/11/18, 11:56 AM - Charles G: Ok. Cool
4/11/18, 12:03 PM - Hannah Guedenet: The New Hampshire car wash is not cheap. But that car is nasty. I can't drive it
4/11/18, 12:16 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Not a single person around me is speaking English...
4/11/18, 12:23 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Ugh I need to go and they 
Take a really long time
4/11/18, 1:28 PM - Hannah Guedenet: At the airport. Funny to be traveling domestically in the middle of the week...
4/11/18, 2:20 PM - Hannah Guedenet: On the plane.
4/11/18, 2:20 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Your mom mentioned that your dad hasn't had luck with the child care stuff. I'm freaking out a little.
4/11/18, 2:21 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Talk to her and then we need to reach out to your cousins. Your mom also seems to think you and I can't write in French... I was slightly offended.
4/11/18, 2:48 PM - Charles G: It's still early. He's only been there a few days

4/11/18, 4:47 PM - Hannah Guedenet: The Grand rapids airport is very nice...
4/11/18, 4:48 PM - Hannah Guedenet: And there's a direct flight to Houston! I think we should reconsider. 😁
4/11/18, 4:48 PM - Charles G: Ok. Home
4/11/18, 4:48 PM - Charles G: Hahaha
4/11/18, 4:49 PM - Charles G: Hey, do we have any balsamic vinegar?
4/11/18, 4:49 PM - Hannah Guedenet: I think so...
4/11/18, 4:49 PM - Hannah Guedenet: There should be some next to the stove

4/20/18, 8:54 PM - Charles G: Hey. I'm in bed now. About Airbnb, I understand.
4/20/18, 8:55 PM - Charles G: Night went alright. I miss you. Having fun
4/20/18, 8:55 PM - Charles G: ?
4/20/18, 9:00 PM - Hannah Guedenet: I am having a good time. Some hard discussions
4/20/18, 9:00 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Some tears. But lots of laughter. I'm so tired

6/8/18, 6:33 AM - Hannah Guedenet: And apparently ana told everyone to dress up for our meeting with CJ today. She told them in a meeting on Wednesday that I wasn't at
6/8/18, 6:33 AM - Hannah Guedenet: I'm the only one in jeans and she's going to be pissed
6/8/18, 6:53 AM - Charles G: Oops...

6/8/18, 6:54 AM - Hannah Guedenet: She's just so uptight about clothing and it drives me nuts
6/8/18, 6:54 AM - Charles G: For Kenya, I just don't know. I need to think about and we need to discuss
6/8/18, 6:55 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Ok. I will just mention it to Seth to see if he thinks it is even an option budget wise
6/8/18, 6:56 AM - Charles G: ok
6/8/18, 6:56 AM - Hannah Guedenet: I would have thought this was a no brainier for you
6/8/18, 6:56 AM - Charles G: wasn't it seth who promised the job in Burkina Faso and then totally changed his mind?
6/8/18, 6:57 AM - Charles G: really??
6/8/18, 6:57 AM - Charles G: why?
6/8/18, 6:57 AM - Hannah Guedenet: No that was Ana
6/8/18, 6:57 AM - Hannah Guedenet: She didn't promise anything
6/8/18, 6:57 AM - Hannah Guedenet: You've always wanted to get back overseas
6/8/18, 6:59 AM - Charles G: since we moved into our house, I feel like we've put down more roots. There are more reasons to stay put

6/9/18, 10:00 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Just landed in Dubai
6/9/18, 11:16 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Don't forget to let me know if the basement was in good shape and I'll write the review. She has already written one for us. We need to replace that shower rod. It's really rusty
6/9/18, 11:17 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Oh and make sure the outside door to the stairs is locked
6/10/18, 5:47 AM - Hannah Guedenet: I'm in the taxi headed to hotel. I have hardly slept
6/10/18, 5:49 AM - Charles G: Hey
6/10/18, 5:49 AM - Charles G: Thanks for. Letting for the text
6/10/18, 5:51 AM - Hannah Guedenet: I'm assuming that's English...
6/10/18, 5:51 AM - Hannah Guedenet: ;)
6/10/18, 5:51 AM - Charles G: They left the basement in great shape. They made the beds and put all the trash and recycling in one place, near back door
6/10/18, 5:51 AM - Hannah Guedenet: I'm so tired
6/10/18, 5:51 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Awesome!!
6/10/18, 5:51 AM - Charles G: Whatever. Just woke up
6/10/18, 5:51 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Figured.
6/10/18, 5:52 AM - Hannah Guedenet: I had a thought in the airport about having to buy a car and do all of that crap in Kenya...it made me almost want to not do it.
6/10/18, 5:53 AM - Charles G: Oh yeah, i was thinking about having to sell our car and put all our stuff in storage
6/10/18, 5:54 AM - Charles G: And how your family would be pissed. Your bro called. He says you should tip the security guard... He's worried about your safety
6/10/18, 5:55 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Oh good grief
6/10/18, 5:55 AM - Charles G: But I'm coming around to the idea, the more I think about it
6/10/18, 5:56 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Malia would be pissed. And maybe my mom. Everyone else would be fine. Mchan would want to come visit and go on safari
6/10/18, 5:56 AM - Charles G: Yeah, true
6/10/18, 5:57 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Sarah left a great review
6/10/18, 5:58 AM - Hannah Guedenet: It would be so disruptive
6/10/18, 5:58 AM - Hannah Guedenet: But I can't think of another time it would be less disruptive
6/10/18, 6:00 AM - Charles G: Agreed. Itll just get harder as we and girls get older. I just hope the job is something you want and would like
6/10/18, 6:02 AM - Hannah Guedenet: You go to bed on time last night?
6/10/18, 6:02 AM - Charles G: No, of course not
6/10/18, 6:03 AM - Charles G: But I'll do better tonight
6/10/18, 6:04 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Babe...
6/10/18, 6:04 AM - Hannah Guedenet: You have to take care of yourself
6/10/18, 6:04 AM - Hannah Guedenet: And I want to sure it's what is right for our family and us first
6/10/18, 6:09 AM - Charles G: I like that it would be 2 yr contract. It feels more like joining peace corps or something.
6/10/18, 6:12 AM - Charles G: Girls are up... Time to get this day going
6/10/18, 6:12 AM - Charles G: Love you trees beaucoup
6/10/18, 6:16 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Love you too. We can WhatsApp if the girls want to say hi and you have time.

6/10/18, 7:01 AM - Charles G: You still around?
6/10/18, 7:01 AM - Charles G: Just going to jump in shower but maybe after?
6/10/18, 7:02 AM - Hannah Guedenet: I am
6/10/18, 7:03 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Eating something and will take a nap
6/10/18, 7:07 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Maybe we should talk later. You have to head to church
6/10/18, 7:08 AM - Charles G: Ok. That's fine.
6/10/18, 7:08 AM - Charles G: Love you
6/10/18, 7:10 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Love you too
6/10/18, 9:08 AM - Hannah Guedenet: <Media omitted>
6/10/18, 9:22 AM - Hannah Guedenet: And don't forget the meat csa!
6/10/18, 11:29 AM - Charles G: They loved the video! Off to get csa now. So much I want to talk to you about after this morning. Love
6/10/18, 11:59 AM - Hannah Guedenet: I'm back at the hotel if you want to talk!
6/10/18, 12:03 PM - Hannah Guedenet: I'm really curious to hear about this morning!!
6/10/18, 12:41 PM - Hannah Guedenet: I'm starting to get tired. Not sure how much longer I can make it
6/10/18, 12:42 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Also I forgot my spiritual direction book. I'm debating getting the Kindle version. You could read the hard copy
6/10/18, 12:56 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Ugh I'm fading and can't keep my eyes open. Send me a video with your thoughts. Huge hugs to the girls!!!
6/10/18, 12:56 PM - Hannah Guedenet: I love you so much. Xoxox
6/10/18, 12:57 PM - Charles G: Ok
6/10/18, 12:57 PM - Charles G: Sorry. Been running around, getting lunch ready and cleaning up
6/10/18, 12:57 PM - Charles G: I love you!!!
6/11/18, 1:33 AM - Hannah Guedenet: <Media omitted>
6/11/18, 6:54 AM - Charles G: Thanks! I'll share with girls this evening.
6/11/18, 6:55 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Oh it was more for you. I'll make one for them.
6/11/18, 6:55 AM - Charles G: Three questions: where do you keep the Airbnb guest towels, how do you reset the door number code, and where do you store the covers from the air mattress?
6/11/18, 6:56 AM - Charles G: Oops. Sorry. I didn't see it this morning and now I'm on the metro. I'll look at it at work 😊
6/11/18, 7:21 AM - Hannah Guedenet: 1) they go under the sink in the bathroom; 2) the directions for the lock are on the shelf in the kitchen. The master code is written on the piece of paper with the instructions (it's a color print off). 3) I put them in the dresser but Ellen might need all the dresser drawers. I can figure it out when I'm home.
6/11/18, 7:21 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Also we have lots of hangars if Ellen needs more. I'm assuming she finally showed up?
6/11/18, 8:29 AM - Hannah Guedenet: We're done for the day and headed to dinner.
6/11/18, 8:29 AM - Hannah Guedenet: I emailed Carrie about living in Nairobi. And turns out they're moving to Seattle !!
6/11/18, 10:54 AM - Charles G: Ellen arrived late last night.
6/11/18, 10:54 AM - Charles G: Bummer about Carrie. What is it with everyone moving to Seattle??
6/11/18, 11:25 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Sorry about Ellen
6/11/18, 11:25 AM - Hannah Guedenet: That's annoying

6/17/18, 12:16 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Not south
6/17/18, 12:16 PM - Charles G: Btw, should I start laundry or do you want me to wait for your dirty clothes?
6/17/18, 12:16 PM - Hannah Guedenet: I feel like everyone I've been people have struck up conversations with me
6/17/18, 12:16 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Wait

6/17/18, 12:30 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Ok I'll find it
6/17/18, 12:30 PM - Hannah Guedenet: I'm assuming you meant Thai and not that
6/17/18, 12:32 PM - Charles G: yeah, I love Thai!!
6/17/18, 12:33 PM - Charles G: :)
6/17/18, 12:33 PM - Charles G: I'd also be up to going to the japanese place we went to for mother's day
6/17/18, 12:33 PM - Hannah Guedenet: How was church?
6/17/18, 12:34 PM - Hannah Guedenet: The Japanese place isn't really on way home but I'll see how far it is
6/17/18, 12:34 PM - Hannah Guedenet: That would be good
6/17/18, 12:34 PM - Charles G: church was fine. Ruth spoke about hearing God on scripture

6/17/18, 1:56 PM - Charles G: good analysis thought

6/17/18, 2:23 PM - Hannah Guedenet: On the plane
6/17/18, 2:23 PM - Hannah Guedenet: See you soon! Love you!!
6/17/18, 3:15 PM - Charles G: We should make a list of everything we need to do before leaving
6/17/18, 4:15 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Yes
6/17/18, 4:15 PM - Hannah Guedenet: I've landed
6/18/18, 12:20 PM - Charles G: Franklin's cat is so hot
6/18/18, 12:22 PM - Charles G: Traffic is bad
6/18/18, 12:23 PM - Charles G: Car, not cat

6/18/18, 3:12 PM - Charles G: 5:50. I'm on the plane now. Seats are so big!
6/18/18, 3:15 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Enjoy!! You'll be back on that same flight in two weeks with your whole family!
6/18/18, 3:15 PM - Hannah Guedenet: I love you. Thank you for the sweet card. You're amazing
6/18/18, 3:40 PM - Charles G: Love you!! Meant it all
6/18/18, 3:42 PM - Charles G: There's a mom with a chubby 1.5 year old on her lap, in row on front of me
6/18/18, 3:42 PM - Charles G: She's got diaper bag and everything at her feet. Feel sorry for her
6/18/18, 3:52 PM - Hannah Guedenet: That's no fun
6/18/18, 3:53 PM - Charles G: Ok. Taking off soon. Have fun with girls tonight. Bisous
6/18/18, 3:53 PM - Hannah Guedenet: They were both in tears in the car ride home. Think they're tired and hot. We'll try to do an early evening
6/18/18, 3:53 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Bisous
6/18/18, 8:16 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Going to bed (not too late!). The night didn't go super well. Addie was uber whiney about everything and I yelled at her at one point. I think they were both just tired. As was I. Tomorrow will be better but it's just a reminder what an incredible dad you are. I feel so inferior. I love you and hope your flight went smoothly. Xoxox
6/18/18, 11:56 PM - Charles G: Oh man. Sorry. I hope tomorrow goes better. Charlotte can't stay up late reading.
6/18/18, 11:58 PM - Charles G: Flight was ok. The chubby baby cried a lot.
6/19/18, 4:13 AM - Hannah Guedenet: That sucks. I'm sorry
6/19/18, 6:56 AM - Hannah Guedenet: I don't know how to tell Malia that employers are not spending as much time thinking about her and wondering about her as she thinks they are.
6/19/18, 11:29 AM - Charles G: In rwanda now. Good flight from Brussels.
6/19/18, 11:30 AM - Charles G: She doesn't have anyone else to talk to about these things
6/19/18, 11:30 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Rwanda??
6/19/18, 11:30 AM - Charles G: Just a stopover
6/19/18, 11:33 AM - Charles G: How you doing? Morning go ok?
6/19/18, 11:34 AM - Hannah Guedenet: I know she doesn't but she also isn't the most mentally stable person I know
6/19/18, 11:34 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Morning was ok. Looks like Addie might have actually participated in water play. She wore her suit
6/19/18, 11:34 AM - Charles G: Wow! :)
6/19/18, 11:34 AM - Hannah Guedenet: I have so many things to do. My head is swimming and there aren't enough hours in the day. I don't know how you function like this on a regular basis
6/19/18, 11:37 AM - Charles G: Its why I let balls drop sometimes. Thanks for empathizing
6/19/18, 11:39 AM - Hannah Guedenet: I would be a mess if this was my life
6/19/18, 11:40 AM - Hannah Guedenet: I'm really impatient with Ana. I don't think she realizes how much I'm juggling and keeps asking me for ridiculous small things - like making the cover for the board book
6/19/18, 11:40 AM - Hannah Guedenet: I'm nervous about telling her I can't come back from the tech summit...
6/19/18, 11:45 AM - Charles G: Ana has always been so accommodating whenever you've asked for anything
6/19/18, 11:46 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Yeah but she was pretty adamant that if I went to France, I had to still be willing to travel
6/19/18, 11:47 AM - Charles G: Ugh
6/19/18, 11:49 AM - Charles G: Maybe I should ask not to go to Moz
6/19/18, 11:49 AM - Charles G: I can ask to reschedule
6/19/18, 11:50 AM - Hannah Guedenet: No let's see how the conversation goes
6/19/18, 11:50 AM - Hannah Guedenet: I've never said no
6/19/18, 3:09 PM - Hannah Guedenet: You at your hotel yet?
6/19/18, 3:09 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Oh shoot. Forgot to bring up the tech summit with Ana.
6/19/18, 3:28 PM - Charles G: Finally made it to hotel. I'm exhausted.
6/19/18, 3:29 PM - Hannah Guedenet: I'm sure you are. What time do you start tomorrow? Picking up girls now
6/19/18, 3:34 PM - Charles G: Wednesday, Thursday, Friday it's from 4:30 to 7:30. Do I can sleep in
6/19/18, 3:34 PM - Charles G: Tell girls I move them
6/19/18, 3:34 PM - Charles G: Love them
6/19/18, 3:41 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Will do
6/19/18, 3:41 PM - Hannah Guedenet: They want a video
6/19/18, 3:52 PM - Charles G: Tonight? Ugh. Ok. Was going to wait till tomorrow

6/19/18, 6:28 PM - Hannah Guedenet: <Media omitted>
6/20/18, 12:02 AM - Charles G: 😍🤩 thanks
6/20/18, 5:11 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Listened to more stories from the border this AM. It is possible these parents might never see their kids again. There is no system for tracking them. It's a mess. I ended up just crying in the kitchen.
6/20/18, 5:11 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Only action I could figure out to take as to write to Jamie raskin. I also asked him if he knows of orgs working along the border that we could support.
6/20/18, 7:00 AM - Hannah Guedenet: https://www.crcc.org/on-world-refugee-day/
6/20/18, 7:00 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Thoughtful piece by Matthew
6/20/18, 7:57 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Poor Morocco they had so many chances but just couldn't finish
6/20/18, 11:17 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Question for you - there seem to be Airbnb sheets and pillows in the closet upstairs. Are the sheets clean? (And they're stored downstairs in the dresser).
6/20/18, 12:02 PM - Charles G: Yeah, they're clean. I didn't want to use up the space in the dresser if Ellen wanted to use it
6/20/18, 12:02 PM - Charles G: Just realized that Derek won't have a place to hang his clothes for 2 months....
6/20/18, 12:03 PM - Charles G: Still haven't had dinner... Finally on our way to restaurant
6/20/18, 12:48 PM - Hannah Guedenet: No he won't. Oh well
6/20/18, 12:48 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Glad to hear from you.
6/20/18, 12:48 PM - Hannah Guedenet: What a long day
6/20/18, 12:59 PM - Charles G: <Media omitted>
6/20/18, 2:08 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Yum!
6/20/18, 2:08 PM - Hannah Guedenet: But it's so late!!
6/20/18, 2:08 PM - Hannah Guedenet: For some reason I'm totally missing your messages
6/20/18, 2:20 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Trump signed an exec order keeping families together while awaiting prosecution
6/20/18, 2:21 PM - Charles G: Wow
6/20/18, 2:22 PM - Charles G: Hey, want to talk ?
6/20/18, 2:22 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Sure
6/20/18, 2:40 PM - Charles G: <Media omitted>
6/20/18, 2:41 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Ohh!!
6/20/18, 2:41 PM - Hannah Guedenet: When you said don't forget about the plants outside. Are there bonsais outside???
6/20/18, 2:43 PM - Charles G: Yes! In the wooden box, to the right of car
6/20/18, 2:44 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Ohhhh
6/20/18, 2:45 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Would it get water if it rains by any chance??
6/21/18, 12:39 AM - Charles G: It would probably get some water...
6/21/18, 5:00 AM - Charles G: <Media omitted>
6/21/18, 5:02 AM - Charles G: <Media omitted>
6/21/18, 6:48 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Loved the videos. Thanks. Had another rough morning. Both whiney about things. Like c left her swim shirt in her bag so it was still wet and smelly. And Addie was up at 6:15. Then woke up c with her crying when I told her to go back to bed. I'm at my wit's end
6/21/18, 7:17 AM - Charles G: Oh goodness
6/21/18, 7:17 AM - Charles G: I'm sorry
6/21/18, 7:19 AM - Hannah Guedenet: I shouldn't be burdening you with it.
6/21/18, 7:20 AM - Hannah Guedenet: I did figure out this am that I have to be silly and that helps. I just don't always have the energy to be silly
6/21/18, 12:03 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Ana's fine with me not coming back for the summit
6/21/18, 12:57 PM - Charles G: Oh good. She want at all upset or annoyed?
6/21/18, 1:02 PM - Hannah Guedenet: No she had actually asked me if I was ok with us both being out of the country and I brushed it off.
6/21/18, 1:03 PM - Charles G: Than why were you so nervous about it?
6/21/18, 1:03 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Because she had been so insistent
6/21/18, 1:35 PM - Charles G: Its 10:30 and I'm in bed. Yay for me. Will probably read a little
6/21/18, 1:36 PM - Charles G: I started an email to you but will finish it tomorrow.
6/21/18, 1:36 PM - Charles G: I'll do a video for the girls now
6/21/18, 1:38 PM - Charles G: And one for you
6/21/18, 1:40 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Nice!!

6/21/18, 1:50 PM - Charles G: <Media omitted>
6/21/18, 1:51 PM - Charles G: I used the wrong song on my clippers and barely have any beard left
6/21/18, 1:51 PM - Charles G: Song=setting
6/21/18, 1:58 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Oh wow. Beardless man! I'm cutting off all my hair. Argentina lost 3-0 to Croatia
6/21/18, 2:00 PM - Charles G: Oh no!! Poor Argentina. Ugh. What is up with this works cup?

6/22/18, 10:34 AM - Hannah Guedenet: So I'm thinking I'll cancel our tickets to the npr thing next week. You're right that things are too crazy. And it's not a full concert

6/23/18, 3:16 AM - Charles G: And it's still early Saturday... Just now realizing that. Anyways, hope your Saturday is great.
6/23/18, 6:21 AM - Hannah Guedenet: I'm confused what seems stressful with the neighbors?
6/23/18, 6:21 AM - Hannah Guedenet: I hope the training is going well. That's quite a huge room you're in.
6/23/18, 7:12 AM - Charles G: All the stuff with gynkana seemed stressful
6/23/18, 7:12 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Oh between them yes. Not for me
6/23/18, 7:13 AM - Charles G: Almost done. I'm exhausted. We've gone focus group, key informant interviews, and employer survey data today. Phew!

6/23/18, 10:02 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Omg we are at this nature center and parents just let their kids do whatever the hell they want!! The poor lady is trying to get the kids to sit down and the parents are doing nothing to help!!

6/24/18, 6:01 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Sleepover not a success. At 2 am Charlotte was still awake and tossing and turning. Then I had to get Addie more blankets for her sleeping pad. The pads are super noisy. And then Ellen woke me up a little after 7 in the kitchen

6/25/18, 5:07 AM - Charles G: <Media omitted>
6/25/18, 5:30 AM - Charles G: I hope you're morning is going well. Thinking of you.

6/25/18, 5:37 AM - Charles G: So much to get done at work too... Before taking off

6/25/18, 5:45 AM - Charles G: Ok
6/25/18, 5:47 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Char is doing great about being excited for a new summer camp. I was really afraid she would be nervous about not knowing anyone
6/25/18, 5:53 AM - Charles G: Yeah, me too. That's good to hear. I feel like she's been trying to speak French more as prep
6/25/18, 7:34 AM - Hannah Guedenet: I forgot this but Mary from ASI just got to Kampala.
6/25/18, 8:27 AM - Charles G: You're just now remembering? Too bad we don't overlap more
6/25/18, 8:58 AM - Hannah Guedenet: She was in Senegal last week. I didn't know when she was going to Kampala. I haven't seen her since before I went to Tz
6/25/18, 8:58 AM - Hannah Guedenet: I had to ask our neighbors to turn down the music again. I was on a call with romain and they started blasting it.
6/25/18, 8:59 AM - Hannah Guedenet: I'm not sure any of them speak English and I don't speak Spanish. Communication is not easy.
6/25/18, 10:07 AM - Charles G: What is ASI doing in Kampala? I can recommend places for her to go. Definitely recommend ndere center, where I was last night
6/25/18, 10:08 AM - Charles G: Annoying that neighbors were playing music
6/25/18, 10:09 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Training World food programme staff
6/25/18, 10:09 AM - Hannah Guedenet: I'll ask her if she needs recs
6/25/18, 10:11 AM - Charles G: Ok. Cool
6/25/18, 10:13 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Seth just told me we should go to Kenya for 3 years...
6/25/18, 10:23 AM - Charles G: Haha
6/25/18, 10:24 AM - Charles G: Did he say why?
6/25/18, 11:38 AM - Hannah Guedenet: I think he and Ana want to make sure I'm happy
6/25/18, 11:38 AM - Hannah Guedenet: That I can manage the project well
6/25/18, 11:38 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Right now I just so dislike most aspects of my job
6/25/18, 11:39 AM - Charles G: Yeah...
6/25/18, 11:39 AM - Charles G: Are you reconsidering?
6/25/18, 11:40 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Yeah what?
6/25/18, 11:40 AM - Hannah Guedenet: I think I'm getting back on Instagram. I miss it
6/25/18, 11:40 AM - Hannah Guedenet: And lately I've been looking at Twitter which is just ugly and angry
6/25/18, 11:43 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Reconsidering what?
6/25/18, 11:56 AM - Hannah Guedenet: ??
6/25/18, 11:59 AM - Charles G: We we're taking about Kenya. Nevermind
6/25/18, 11:59 AM - Charles G: At the airport now. 1 hour delay
6/25/18, 12:00 PM - Charles G: Means I won't leave until after midnight. It's hot here
6/25/18, 12:00 PM - Charles G: We got here way too early
6/25/18, 12:00 PM - Hannah Guedenet: I'm not reconsidering Kenya
6/25/18, 12:00 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Sorry about the delay. That sucks
6/25/18, 12:01 PM - Hannah Guedenet: How long do you have in Brussels?
6/25/18, 12:01 PM - Hannah Guedenet: I haven't exercised in over a week. I feel so gross
6/25/18, 12:16 PM - Charles G: 3.5 hours in Brussels although maybe less since there's a delay
6/25/18, 12:17 PM - Charles G: Yeah, I felt the same way when you traveled. Did you sleep better last night?
6/25/18, 12:19 PM - Charles G: I saw yesterday on nytimes that 90% of Republicans approve of Trump, according to poll. That depressed me for about an hour.
6/25/18, 12:23 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Yeah the world is not a happy place. It's worse when you think about how many of those Republicans identify as Christian
6/25/18, 12:23 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Can you at least watch soccer while you wait?
6/25/18, 12:37 PM - Charles G: Yes, so sad and frustrating.
6/25/18, 12:37 PM - Charles G: I don't see any tv screens. Who's playing?
6/25/18, 12:38 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Seriously? The Tz airport at least had them... Spain and Morocco. And Iran and Portugal. Spain and Portugal have 4 points in their group. Iran 3 so it's very close
6/25/18, 12:38 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Spain and Morocco currently tied at 1-1
6/25/18, 12:42 PM - Charles G: Man, I'm missing so much WC
6/25/18, 12:43 PM - Charles G: Airport had really fast and free WiFi
6/25/18, 12:43 PM - Hannah Guedenet: I'm looking at jobs at DC central kitchen. One of the jobs only pays $60k...
6/25/18, 12:44 PM - Charles G: Yeah, I know. We're expensive
6/25/18, 12:45 PM - Charles G: Plus, you would miss the travel.
6/25/18, 12:45 PM - Charles G: After a while
6/25/18, 12:45 PM - Hannah Guedenet: I don't know..
6/25/18, 12:50 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Maybe one of us needs to be willing to take a pay cut to do what we want
6/25/18, 12:55 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Ugh I was looking at domestic jobs and it's all stuff that sounds so much more interesting
6/25/18, 12:57 PM - Charles G: Yeah, I was thinking the same thing... About one if us taking a pay cut to pursue what we want
6/25/18, 12:58 PM - Charles G: Send me a link if you find something
6/25/18, 1:02 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Will do
6/25/18, 1:02 PM - Hannah Guedenet: I don't think I can seriously start looking until after France. So I shouldn't start
6/25/18, 1:03 PM - Hannah Guedenet: I have become an old lady. I've increased the displayed font size on my computer to the biggest size...
6/25/18, 1:10 PM - Charles G: Ha. Maybe you need better glasses
6/25/18, 1:11 PM - Charles G: I'm happy with the presents I got you all
6/25/18, 1:11 PM - Charles G: I did pretty good this time
6/25/18, 1:12 PM - Hannah Guedenet: You got us presents?
6/25/18, 1:19 PM - Charles G: Of course. I always do... Well, not always for you
6/25/18, 1:19 PM - Charles G: I need to buy some comfy travel pants.
6/25/18, 1:19 PM - Hannah Guedenet: I look forward to a present then
6/25/18, 1:20 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Hey I may just meet you at the event tomorrow night if it looks like you'll get home in time to pick up Addie and Kai
6/25/18, 1:20 PM - Hannah Guedenet: And yes comfy pants are a must
6/25/18, 1:29 PM - Charles G: Ok. That's fine.
6/25/18, 1:29 PM - Charles G: When does it start and end?
6/25/18, 1:29 PM - Hannah Guedenet: I'll leave a key in the car
6/25/18, 1:29 PM - Hannah Guedenet: 7-8:30
6/25/18, 1:30 PM - Hannah Guedenet: The NPR building is near my office. Just easier than going back and forth
6/25/18, 1:30 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Not sure about dinner...
6/25/18, 1:30 PM - Charles G: I don't have a key to house either. I'll have to use our backup
6/25/18, 1:30 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Also not sure if you should Lyft or drive
6/25/18, 1:30 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Parking could be a pain
6/25/18, 1:31 PM - Hannah Guedenet: You could go in the basement door
6/25/18, 1:31 PM - Hannah Guedenet: 725240
6/25/18, 1:32 PM - Charles G: Yeah, I could. Kai is at TPCDC?
6/25/18, 1:34 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Yes
6/25/18, 1:34 PM - Hannah Guedenet: We can talk tomorrow once you're in the van and figure out a plan
6/25/18, 1:35 PM - Hannah Guedenet: You know where tpcdc is right?
6/25/18, 1:35 PM - Charles G: It's on that side street from Maple
6/25/18, 1:36 PM - Charles G: Tulip?
6/25/18, 1:39 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Yes next to the Presbyterian Church
6/25/18, 1:41 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Yes
6/25/18, 1:41 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Morocco just scored. Think they just kicked Spain out.
6/25/18, 1:44 PM - Charles G: Wow. Are all three favorites out?? Is French still in?
6/25/18, 1:45 PM - Hannah Guedenet: France is in yes
6/25/18, 1:45 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Portugal is in
6/25/18, 1:46 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Are you planning to work next week?
6/25/18, 1:46 PM - Hannah Guedenet: I'm realizing I don't have as much vacation as I thought
6/25/18, 1:47 PM - Hannah Guedenet: I might work Thursday and some Friday
6/25/18, 1:52 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Spain scored in stoppage
6/25/18, 1:52 PM - Hannah Guedenet: So think they are through...I can't follow
6/25/18, 1:58 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Well it was exciting at the end but predictable result. Spain and Portugal through
6/25/18, 1:58 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Iran tied with Portugal though. Good games!!!
6/25/18, 2:07 PM - Charles G: Oh wow
6/25/18, 2:12 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Did you see my question about work next week???
6/25/18, 2:26 PM - Charles G: Sorry, was reflecting on workshop with Nina
6/25/18, 2:26 PM - Charles G: I was planning to work one day next week
6/25/18, 2:26 PM - Hannah Guedenet: No worries
6/25/18, 2:27 PM - Charles G: But I can play it by ear.
6/25/18, 2:28 PM - Charles G: Depends on how girls are doing, how busy work is...
6/25/18, 2:28 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Ok me too
6/25/18, 2:29 PM - Hannah Guedenet: I do have to be on a call for 1 hour Tuesday afternoon...

7/21/18, 3:15 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Oh and your mom apparently thought that Kai and Aria weren't Aubin's kids because they don't have his name... That was a fun conversation

7/29/18, 8:46 AM - Charles G: Fyi: Although it tastes and smells much like Campari, Aperol has an alcohol content of 11%—less than half that of Campari. Aperol and Campari have the same sugar content,[2] and Aperol is less bitter in taste. Campari is also much darker in color.
7/29/18, 5:35 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Thanks for the info. I'm back in DC. Headed to Airbnb. Screaming baby the entire flight
7/29/18, 7:12 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Reflections...DC is becoming a town of white 20 somethings. The whole foods on H St is weird.
7/29/18, 7:12 PM - Hannah Guedenet: And I did miss beer. Got a troegs perpetual IPA
7/29/18, 7:22 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Also internet is super fast!!!

7/30/18, 4:08 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Oh man. I'm sorry
7/30/18, 4:08 AM - Hannah Guedenet: I slept well.
7/30/18, 4:08 AM - Hannah Guedenet: How's Addie?
7/30/18, 4:09 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Other observations... Fruit is hella expensive at whole foods (though prime members now get an additional 10% off)
7/30/18, 4:09 AM - Hannah Guedenet: DC is diverse
7/30/18, 4:10 AM - Charles G: She was ok this morning until it as time to get out of the car to go to my parents' house
7/30/18, 4:10 AM - Charles G: She had a little "no" freakout
7/30/18, 4:10 AM - Charles G: 10% is not insignificant. Pretty cool
7/30/18, 4:11 AM - Charles G: Amazon's goal must be to get as many services on Prime as possible so that no one will ever want to get off
7/30/18, 4:20 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Yeah that seems like their strategy
7/30/18, 4:21 AM - Hannah Guedenet: and bummer i gave you my amazon credit card - i get 5% cash bask on it when i shop at whole foods
7/30/18, 4:21 AM - Hannah Guedenet: sorry about addie

7/30/18, 4:45 AM - Hannah Guedenet: eek...i'm sorry

7/30/18, 4:45 AM - Hannah Guedenet: i thought you had made  a lot of progress on the indicators
7/30/18, 4:46 AM - Charles G: I did initially but have put it on the back burner the last couple of weeks
7/30/18, 5:21 AM - Hannah Guedenet: omg the internet is so fast
7/30/18, 5:21 AM - Charles G: ha
7/30/18, 5:21 AM - Charles G: so weird that you're at your office, in DC, in AC, with fast internet
7/30/18, 5:21 AM - Hannah Guedenet: i missed it
7/30/18, 5:21 AM - Hannah Guedenet: i'm not at the office yet
7/30/18, 5:21 AM - Hannah Guedenet: still at Airbnb
7/30/18, 5:21 AM - Hannah Guedenet: oh...need to take a video
7/30/18, 5:22 AM - Charles G: yeah, I want to see the airbnb
7/30/18, 5:47 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Omg. A good cup of coffee!!!
7/30/18, 5:48 AM - Hannah Guedenet: <Media omitted>
7/30/18, 5:49 AM - Charles G: <Media omitted>
7/30/18, 5:49 AM - Charles G: maybe you should bring back our mocha
7/30/18, 5:51 AM - Hannah Guedenet: I might. Also there is so much honking
7/30/18, 5:55 AM - Hannah Guedenet: <Media omitted>
7/30/18, 6:14 AM - Charles G: I guess there are still some things that are better in the US
7/30/18, 6:15 AM - Hannah Guedenet: But I do have to say reading Richard rohr and being on H Street makes me really sad.
7/30/18, 6:16 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Where did all the poor people who were here before go???
7/30/18, 6:16 AM - Hannah Guedenet: So many white people walking dogs and pushing strollers
7/30/18, 6:16 AM - Charles G: yeah, it's so segregated
7/30/18, 6:17 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Ok have to get to work
7/30/18, 10:54 AM - Charles G: Hey there. Can we try a calling later today?
7/30/18, 11:02 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Sure when?
7/30/18, 11:11 AM - Hannah Guedenet: I'm free at like 9 your time
7/30/18, 11:38 AM - Charles G: Oh, ok. That works
7/30/18, 11:45 AM - Hannah Guedenet: I can't do in 10 mins. We're in a session
7/30/18, 11:45 AM - Hannah Guedenet: I did talk to Charlotte for a few mins. She seemed really good
7/30/18, 1:02 PM - Charles G: <Media omitted>
7/30/18, 1:02 PM - Charles G: Ready when you are
7/30/18, 1:02 PM - Charles G: It's a miracle. Addie is already for bed and it's only 9
7/30/18, 1:08 PM - Hannah Guedenet: <Media omitted>
7/30/18, 2:50 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Did you talk to c tonight?
7/30/18, 4:51 PM - Charles G: yeah, we talked. She was just getting started with Sleeping Queens
7/30/18, 4:52 PM - Charles G: I hope she's OK. I'm going to be so proud of her. This summer has been really incredible for both girls. Addie did great all day (minus a minor little cry in the morning).
7/30/18, 4:53 PM - Hannah Guedenet: I'm super proud of Charlotte. I do think we need to get her on Saturday though. Another night with Leah seems like a lot. Why are you still up???
7/30/18, 4:53 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Babe...it's super late there
7/30/18, 4:53 PM - Charles G: Ok, going to bed finally. I ordered the mosquito net for the door. It should arrive at ACDI/Voca office this Thursday. I used the mailing address on the AV website since it wasn't already in Amazon
7/30/18, 4:53 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Also I forgot how good beer is...
7/30/18, 4:53 PM - Charles G: :0
7/30/18, 4:53 PM - Charles G: :)
7/30/18, 4:53 PM - Hannah Guedenet: It was already in Amazon, btw
7/30/18, 4:53 PM - Hannah Guedenet: But thanks
7/30/18, 4:54 PM - Charles G: i love you!!!
7/30/18, 4:54 PM - Charles G: tomorrow, I'm going to bed at a reasonable time
7/30/18, 4:54 PM - Hannah Guedenet: I love you too
7/30/18, 4:54 PM - Hannah Guedenet: I'm also ordering Yahtzee!!
7/30/18, 4:54 PM - Charles G: maybe we can talk more tomorrow too? I want to hear about your day
7/30/18, 4:54 PM - Charles G: yeah, that'll arrive Thursday too :)
7/30/18, 4:54 PM - Charles G: signing off now. Bisous!!
7/30/18, 4:55 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Oh shoot!!! That is not the Yahtzee I wanted!!!
7/30/18, 4:55 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Goodnight
7/30/18, 4:57 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Ugh babe. Seriously. You had them shipped to our house.
7/30/18, 4:58 PM - Hannah Guedenet: I'll reorder tomorrow. I canceled the whole order
7/31/18, 1:52 AM - Charles G: I did? I was having weird internet problems last night. You could have just changed the address.
7/31/18, 4:32 AM - Hannah Guedenet: I was on my phone and it wouldn't let me.
7/31/18, 4:32 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Hope your day is going well so far
7/31/18, 4:34 AM - Charles G: good morning!!
7/31/18, 4:34 AM - Charles G: thanks for the nice email. I was going to respond before you woke up but I guess I'm late
7/31/18, 4:35 AM - Charles G: but not too late. I'll respond now
7/31/18, 4:35 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Haha ok
7/31/18, 4:36 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Hey do you want me to bring you back any bars or mixed nuts? I'm right next to whole foods
7/31/18, 4:39 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Also I just shared that Charlotte swimming video. I'm sure your mom is going to say she needs to get rid of the arm bands...
7/31/18, 4:40 AM - Charles G: no, I've got lots of snacks but thanks
7/31/18, 4:41 AM - Charles G: my mom said she talked to a swim instructor but didn't like him. He said that if Char wasn't swimming at 6, she probably had a swim phobia (??!!). Plus, he wanted to charge 300 euros
7/31/18, 4:41 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Yeah she mentioned that to me before I left
7/31/18, 4:41 AM - Hannah Guedenet: She's welcome to pay for Addie to take lessons. 😁
7/31/18, 4:43 AM - Hannah Guedenet: It looks like Anna is working her up to getting rid of the arm bands
7/31/18, 4:43 AM - Hannah Guedenet: How's Addie
7/31/18, 4:44 AM - Charles G: my heart wants to burst. She's making so much progress in the water!! I guess it's one of those things where it's best if the parent is not the one teaching
7/31/18, 4:44 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Yeah I think so. And it turns out Anna has some experience.
7/31/18, 4:45 AM - Charles G: yes she does
7/31/18, 4:46 AM - Charles G: I think Lea has been a huge encouragement too.
7/31/18, 4:46 AM - Charles G: I wonder if she mostly talks to Charlotte is French?
7/31/18, 4:56 AM - Charles G: Addie is doing great. She's in her cute and sweet mode right now. I hope it lasts.
7/31/18, 5:59 AM - Charles G: by the way, did you email the Mathers about Cutie? If not, I can email them
7/31/18, 6:09 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Texting now
7/31/18, 6:10 AM - Charles G: ok
7/31/18, 6:10 AM - Charles G: thanks
7/31/18, 12:45 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Just saw an email from KAA. Ms Christine left
7/31/18, 1:18 PM - Charles G: Sorry, A wanted to try
7/31/18, 1:18 PM - Charles G: We'll send a message
7/31/18, 1:19 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Give me two mins
7/31/18, 1:19 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Missed video call
7/31/18, 1:20 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Missed video call
7/31/18, 1:21 PM - Hannah Guedenet: I'm trying to call
7/31/18, 1:55 PM - Hannah Guedenet: I'm feeling very snarky... Charlotte definitely looks like a traumatized child. We have scarred her for life.
7/31/18, 2:18 PM - Hannah Guedenet: I've been eating so bad since getting here. I feel gross. And I'm so tired.
7/31/18, 2:18 PM - Hannah Guedenet: I hope you're going to bed soon...
7/31/18, 2:23 PM - Charles G: for a second there, I was worried that I had missed a video of Charlotte being traumatized!
7/31/18, 2:23 PM - Hannah Guedenet: That's why I prefaced it with me being snakey
7/31/18, 2:23 PM - Charles G: but then saw that you prefaced that statement by saying you were feeling snarky
7/31/18, 2:23 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Snarky
7/31/18, 2:23 PM - Charles G: snakey?
7/31/18, 2:23 PM - Charles G: haha
7/31/18, 2:24 PM - Charles G: I think it's funny that you're rediscovering American food and drinks. I guess being away for awhile makes you appreciate what you had
7/31/18, 2:25 PM - Charles G: I do miss good coffee....
7/31/18, 2:25 PM - Charles G: we're out of Lavazza so I've making that nasty black coffee
7/31/18, 2:26 PM - Hannah Guedenet: I do like the coffee. Otherwise I prefer French foos
7/31/18, 2:26 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Food
7/31/18, 2:53 PM - Charles G: I'm going to be soon. I love you babe
7/31/18, 3:06 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Love u too
7/31/18, 7:32 PM - Hannah Guedenet: So our house is huge. Feels so unnecessary. I actually felt very little being back. It felt really foreign. The yard is very green and lots of stuff is growing.
7/31/18, 7:32 PM - Hannah Guedenet: They had the AC set at 72!!! I rarely have it below 74. No wonder our bill was so high
7/31/18, 7:33 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Also I couldn't find the hidden key rock. Where is it??? And I don't know what you did to the lock on the basement door but the old master code no longer works.
8/1/18, 4:52 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Morning babe
8/1/18, 4:52 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Sorry about things being rough with Addie. And about the heat. Make sure it cools off before I get back
8/1/18, 4:53 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Just fyi we're using a lot of data so far this month. Are you using it for calls?
8/1/18, 4:55 AM - Hannah Guedenet: I also ended up throwing up last night. Something I ate didn't agree with me and everything I had for dinner came out.
8/1/18, 4:55 AM - Hannah Guedenet: It was lovely.
8/1/18, 4:56 AM - Charles G: oh no! Sorry babe!
8/1/18, 4:56 AM - Charles G: sounds awful
8/1/18, 4:57 AM - Charles G: I had trouble falling asleep again. It's really freaking hot
8/1/18, 4:57 AM - Charles G: some kind of heat wave
8/1/18, 4:57 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Ugh. Not fun
8/1/18, 4:57 AM - Hannah Guedenet: I keep dreaming about ignite
8/1/18, 4:57 AM - Hannah Guedenet: And all I need to do
8/1/18, 4:58 AM - Charles G: I'm not sure why it's showing me as using a lot of data. I haven't made any calls and I'm connected to wifi
8/1/18, 4:59 AM - Hannah Guedenet: You used as much data yesterday as I did
8/1/18, 4:59 AM - Charles G: weird. I didn't even leave the house except to have dinner at my parents' house
8/1/18, 4:59 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Hmmm...sure you're on wifi??
8/1/18, 5:00 AM - Hannah Guedenet: You still have my two credit cards right?m
8/1/18, 5:00 AM - Hannah Guedenet: I needed my Amazon one a couple of times. Wish I hadn't given it to you.
8/1/18, 5:01 AM - Charles G: yes, I have your credit cards
8/1/18, 5:01 AM - Charles G: Did you order the mosquito netting?
8/1/18, 5:03 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Yeah
8/1/18, 5:05 AM - Charles G: how are you going to bring it back? I dont think it'll fit in your suitcase
8/1/18, 5:05 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Really?? I figured it will be folded small
8/1/18, 5:07 AM - Charles G: well, it's the size of our the double doors at les hesperides. Even folded up it's going to biggish. I may be wrong
8/1/18, 5:08 AM - Hannah Guedenet: We'll see
8/1/18, 5:16 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Has your mom made any more comments about char being gone for the week??
8/1/18, 5:17 AM - Charles G: nope. I can her updates and mentioned that she had trouble nights in the beginning but not anymore
8/1/18, 5:41 AM - Charles G: I'm not getting any work done...not motivated
8/1/18, 5:48 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Sorry
8/1/18, 9:09 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Do you know Nanette barkey??
8/1/18, 9:14 AM - Hannah Guedenet: https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/17/style/aperol-spritz-drink-summer.html
8/1/18, 9:14 AM - Hannah Guedenet: We're apparently very trendy
8/1/18, 9:16 AM - Charles G: yes, I know Nanette. She was the MERL Director at Pact after Kerry left
8/1/18, 9:16 AM - Charles G: she's moved somewhere else now
8/1/18, 9:16 AM - Charles G: why?
8/1/18, 9:18 AM - Hannah Guedenet: She's giving a qualitative research training right now that I'm attending...
8/1/18, 9:18 AM - Charles G: <Media omitted>
8/1/18, 9:18 AM - Hannah Guedenet: You're making a panache with Chimay???
8/1/18, 9:19 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Seems fancy
8/1/18, 9:29 AM - Charles G: yeah, not digging it. It's too sweet
8/1/18, 9:31 AM - Hannah Guedenet: That lemon drink isnt what you're supposed to use. It's supposed to be Sprite. That lemon stuff is really sweet
8/1/18, 10:04 AM - Charles G: oh...
8/1/18, 11:08 AM - Hannah Guedenet: We should move to France. Just fyi
8/1/18, 1:11 PM - Charles G: Haha
8/1/18, 1:11 PM - Charles G: Can you talk in a bit?
8/1/18, 1:11 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Ugh we just had a break. Does Addie want to talk?
8/1/18, 1:18 PM - Hannah Guedenet: I'm in a session about youth. Your survey in Uganda really seems ahead of the curve. Nice work babe!!
8/1/18, 1:25 PM - Charles G: Really? Cool
8/1/18, 1:25 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Are y'all free now?
8/1/18, 1:26 PM - Hannah Guedenet: I will sneak out

8/1/18, 4:25 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Why??? It's so late.
8/1/18, 4:25 PM - Charles G: I know...
8/1/18, 4:25 PM - Charles G: Ok, going to sleep. You ok?
8/1/18, 4:26 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Yeah. Tired. Worn out.
8/1/18, 4:26 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Headed to a dinner with gender advisors. Wish I could just go home
8/1/18, 4:28 PM - Charles G: Yeah, me too. I'm ready for us all to be back together again

8/2/18, 6:34 AM - Hannah Guedenet: reread her message
8/2/18, 6:34 AM - Hannah Guedenet: she says she'll be there at lunch time
8/2/18, 6:34 AM - Hannah Guedenet: not sure what you read
8/2/18, 6:35 AM - Charles G: yeah, that's what I read. That's why I said she won't be in Monpellier until afternoon
8/2/18, 6:35 AM - Hannah Guedenet: i interpret that differntly
8/2/18, 6:36 AM - Charles G: could you please explain??
8/2/18, 6:36 AM - Hannah Guedenet: if they're going to be back around lunch, you could pick her up at like 1-2.
8/2/18, 6:36 AM - Hannah Guedenet: i don't know why you need to wait until the evening
8/2/18, 6:37 AM - Charles G: well, she also said to be ready to play Yahtzee Saturday night...?

8/2/18, 3:54 PM - Charles G: Yeah, ok. Will you be able to talk tomorrow?
8/2/18, 3:54 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Sorry you had to deal with the teacher thing. I was going to respond to Lucy's mom

8/2/18, 3:56 PM - Charles G: Ok. Yeah. I was feeling some pressure
8/2/18, 3:56 PM - Hannah Guedenet: I do think communication hasn't been great from KAA mgmt always. But I'm not comfortable signing the letter since we're not there
8/2/18, 3:56 PM - Charles G: Your letter at OEW was much more diplomatic
8/2/18, 3:57 PM - Hannah Guedenet: It did seem a tad long and no real ask coming out of it
8/2/18, 3:57 PM - Hannah Guedenet: And thanks for saying that
8/2/18, 3:58 PM - Hannah Guedenet: I'm going to get a pedicure then run to REI and get myself a birthday present. 😁

9/18/18, 8:10 AM - Hannah Guedenet: desk
9/18/18, 8:10 AM - Hannah Guedenet: sorry you don't have any good headphones
9/18/18, 8:11 AM - Hannah Guedenet: also we had a lot more money when we weren't paying $1800 a month in daycare/aftercare costs...
9/18/18, 8:29 AM - Charles G: I still have euros in wallet from France
9/18/18, 8:30 AM - Charles G: Yeah, I could basically work half time if there weren't daycare costs
9/18/18, 8:31 AM - Hannah Guedenet: ok
9/18/18, 8:37 AM - Charles G: Or we could both work less. Whatever. I agree, 1800 is a lot
9/18/18, 8:40 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Or go to France. AND one of us work less
9/18/18, 8:59 AM - Charles G: Yes
9/18/18, 8:59 AM - Hannah Guedenet: except the idea of france really stresses me out
9/18/18, 9:01 AM - Charles G: The idea of being there or the process of moving?
9/18/18, 9:43 AM - Hannah Guedenet: the process of moving
9/18/18, 9:43 AM - Hannah Guedenet: and figuring out the finances

9/18/18, 1:23 PM - Hannah Guedenet: did you take care of all the chickens or do i need to do that later?
9/18/18, 1:31 PM - Charles G: No, chickens are good for today. I didn't find any eggs
9/18/18, 1:31 PM - Hannah Guedenet: oh bummer
9/18/18, 1:31 PM - Charles G: Didn't have time to clean up kitchen. Sorry
9/18/18, 1:32 PM - Charles G: Franklin is keeping windows down. I think his AC is still broken
9/18/18, 1:35 PM - Hannah Guedenet: K

9/18/18, 2:46 PM - Charles G: Yeah, need to get that reimbursed. That is a lot. Had you transferred enough?
9/18/18, 3:00 PM - Hannah Guedenet: It won't be paid until October

9/18/18, 5:49 PM - Charles G: How are the girls?
9/18/18, 5:49 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Hopefully you'll be able to doze. Addie is being really challenging. Cleaning ladies are coming tomorrow. I'm exhausted
9/18/18, 5:50 PM - Charles G: You have an ok day?
9/18/18, 5:50 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Meh. Lost momentum around 4 and ended up googling therapists and talking with colleagues.

9/18/18, 6:29 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Hello?
9/18/18, 6:34 PM - Charles G: Yes!!
9/18/18, 6:34 PM - Charles G: Was just thinking of that
9/18/18, 6:48 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Omg that was painful
9/18/18, 6:48 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Addie is back to everything is no
9/18/18, 6:49 PM - Hannah Guedenet: And not wanting to sleep
9/18/18, 7:15 PM - Charles G: Oh no
9/18/18, 7:15 PM - Charles G: I'm sorry
9/18/18, 7:16 PM - Charles G: Still not on plane. The crew hasn't arrived
9/18/18, 7:22 PM - Hannah Guedenet: well that's annoying
9/18/18, 7:23 PM - Charles G: They just arrived. People clapped
9/18/18, 7:31 PM - Charles G: A boy has been screaming hysterically for last 10 minutes. He's going to make himself sick
9/18/18, 7:33 PM - Hannah Guedenet: and knowing your luck - he'll be seated right behind you
9/18/18, 7:43 PM - Charles G: Ugh... And I don't have nose cancelling headphones
9/18/18, 7:43 PM - Charles G: Noise
9/18/18, 7:46 PM - Hannah Guedenet: yeah
9/18/18, 7:46 PM - Hannah Guedenet: how long is your layover?
9/18/18, 7:55 PM - Hannah Guedenet: the son on Madam Secretary just used swole...
9/18/18, 8:09 PM - Charles G: Really? How do you say it? Like bowl?
9/18/18, 8:09 PM - Hannah Guedenet: yes
9/18/18, 8:14 PM - Hannah Guedenet: ok going to bed

9/18/18, 8:17 PM - Hannah Guedenet: man - sorry babe
9/18/18, 8:22 PM - Hannah Guedenet: i hate trying to sleep the first night you're gone
9/18/18, 8:26 PM - Charles G: Yeah, me too when you're traveling. Next few months are going to be crazy
9/18/18, 8:27 PM - Charles G: I need to add my trip to Cleveland to the list of trips you sent my parents
9/18/18, 8:36 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Oh yeah...
9/18/18, 8:36 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Crap
9/18/18, 8:37 PM - Charles G: Then no more trips for me on the horizon
9/18/18, 8:37 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Ok really going now. I did finish the neighborhood newsletter and send out stuff about the fall festival (got signatures from our neighbors to close our block). Oh and stopped at Jake's. He was feeding Kai but I think he was high. The place reeked of pot
9/18/18, 8:38 PM - Hannah Guedenet: It really made me sad. Kai was in a high chair eating and watching TV
9/19/18, 4:24 AM - Charles G: Good morning. I'm in Paris. Flight wasn't bad but didn't sleep
9/19/18, 5:44 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Oh man I'm sorry. How long do you have in Paris?? And good morning!!
9/19/18, 5:48 AM - Charles G: Abut 1.5 hours
9/19/18, 5:49 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Good. Glad your plane wasn't any later. I slept pretty well once I fell asleep but it took me awhile. Running around now trying to get house picked up and Addie out the door
9/19/18, 5:49 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Hoping to go for a run today. The sun is finally out
9/19/18, 5:57 AM - Charles G: Enjoy the sun!!
9/19/18, 5:58 AM - Charles G: I'm afraid I didn't pack warm enough clothes. I wish I'd brought my light jacket
9/19/18, 5:59 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Maybe you'll find a nice sweater to buy!
9/19/18, 6:04 AM - Charles G: Maybe but clothes are more expensive here
9/19/18, 6:19 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Omg the cleaning ladies showed up at 8!!!
9/19/18, 6:36 AM - Charles G: Craziness. That is not ok
9/19/18, 6:36 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Yeah I'll say she can't come before 9
9/19/18, 6:39 AM - Charles G: I think I'm getting a cold
9/19/18, 6:39 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Me too. Sore throat, stuffy nose
9/19/18, 6:47 AM - Charles G: Drink an emergency. It's too late for me. I'm not sleeping enough and I'm spending time in germy airports. No hope
9/19/18, 6:49 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Get some OJ
9/19/18, 7:20 AM - Charles G: Taking off soon. Love you. Will text when I arrive
9/19/18, 9:31 AM - Charles G: I'm here!
9/19/18, 9:32 AM - Charles G: Beautiful airport. Going to try busing to hotel. It's cold and cloudy
9/19/18, 9:35 AM - Charles G: Aussi, Sweden is not part of the eu. They use kronas currency
9/19/18, 9:39 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Ahhh well your euros aren't much help
9/19/18, 9:39 AM - Hannah Guedenet: I am really not feeling well...
9/19/18, 9:39 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Good luck with the bus
9/19/18, 9:59 AM - Charles G: There's so much blonde hair here!
9/19/18, 9:59 AM - Charles G: Sorry, babe :(
9/19/18, 10:00 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Haha
9/19/18, 10:00 AM - Hannah Guedenet: I'm sure. And we thought France was white ...
9/19/18, 1:16 PM - Charles G: <Media omitted>
9/19/18, 4:57 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Aubin had to redo the whole cage thing. You had put it in sideways so she fit through the openings of what is the bottom of the cage
9/19/18, 4:57 PM - Hannah Guedenet: I feel awful
9/19/18, 7:13 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Thanks for the video!
9/19/18, 7:14 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Btw, can you put AEA dates on the calendar? I realized i don't even know when it is
9/19/18, 7:29 PM - Hannah Guedenet: <Media omitted>
9/20/18, 4:50 AM - Charles G: Good morning, beautiful
9/20/18, 4:51 AM - Charles G: Sorry about the cage situation. It was a pain getting that cage all setup. Feel awful that Aubin had to do it all over
9/20/18, 5:05 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Hey so sorry I didn't send a message last night. I started reading a book and totally forgot.
9/20/18, 5:05 AM - Hannah Guedenet: And he seemed ok. I feel bad too. I just couldn't figure out how she was getting out!
9/20/18, 5:05 AM - Hannah Guedenet: How's your day going?
9/20/18, 5:27 AM - Charles G: The workshop this morning was great. It was admit self leadership and design. I'll tell you more about it over email but I can't help but apply everything in hearing to us and to parenting
9/20/18, 5:27 AM - Charles G: Going to head back to hotel now to work
9/20/18, 5:28 AM - Charles G: I Quickly walked through the botanical garden too
9/20/18, 6:05 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Look forward to hearing more
9/20/18, 6:57 AM - Hannah Guedenet: I feel so bad. I had a hard time with the girls this morning. I really don't like myself right now. I am in awe of your ability to get out the door with the girls.
9/20/18, 6:59 AM - Hannah Guedenet: I also just let the girls do what they wanted for picture day. A is wearing her I'm adorable shirt. And c is wearing a headband that doesn't match at all. But I got upset about them doing these things. I wish I could just let them be them.
9/20/18, 6:59 AM - Hannah Guedenet: And I know that I just made Charlotte feel crappy. Like I said things that I knew would make her sad.
9/20/18, 7:00 AM - Hannah Guedenet: And I feel horrible
9/20/18, 7:00 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Addie refused to pick out anything ... Took me over 30 mins to get her dressed
9/20/18, 7:00 AM - Charles G: sorry babe.
9/20/18, 7:00 AM - Charles G: Addie loves that "i'm adorable" shirt
9/20/18, 7:01 AM - Charles G: been there, done that
9/20/18, 7:02 AM - Charles G: sounds like a tough morning. is it nice out at least? It's rainy and windy here. So so so tired of rain
9/20/18, 7:02 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Oh man. I'm sorry. The sun is out. It's still muggy and I'm covered in sweat.
9/20/18, 7:04 AM - Charles G: I bought a jacket for $55  🤪
9/20/18, 7:04 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Malia wants so badly for Addie to be like her. I have to just let it go.
9/20/18, 7:04 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Ugh
9/20/18, 7:04 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Didn't you buy one in Argentina too????
9/20/18, 7:04 AM - Hannah Guedenet: You really have a problem
9/20/18, 7:05 AM - Charles G: yeah... This one is slightly warmer
9/20/18, 7:05 AM - Charles G: I'm buying really cheap meals though
9/20/18, 12:38 PM - Hannah Guedenet: i'm not worried about the money - it's just a lot of jackets that have to be purchased last minute

9/21/18, 4:43 AM - Charles G: Thanks for the videos. Good luck this morning. Love you
9/21/18, 5:05 AM - Hannah Guedenet: That is terrifying. Where is that???
9/21/18, 7:26 AM - Hannah Guedenet: morning was a breeze
9/21/18, 7:26 AM - Hannah Guedenet: girls were great - addie was super sweet. she really is such a fun kid when she's not being a complete pain in the ass. she has such a fun spirit - like she makes everything a game
9/21/18, 7:42 AM - Charles G: The fox is in the hotel bar. Yes, very scary.
9/21/18, 7:42 AM - Hannah Guedenet: i'm a little afraid it will give them nightmares...
9/21/18, 7:43 AM - Charles G: Yeah, Addie's sense of humor helps you forget or more quicky get over her stubbornness
9/21/18, 7:43 AM - Charles G: Key note speaker was great but jet lag is kicking in.
9/21/18, 7:44 AM - Hannah Guedenet: i'm sure
9/21/18, 7:44 AM - Hannah Guedenet: is the boat cruise still happening?
9/21/18, 7:47 AM - Charles G: Not sure. They say there are going to be options...maybe bus, maybe cars. Not clear yet
9/21/18, 10:53 AM - Charles G: <Media omitted>
9/21/18, 10:53 AM - Charles G: <Media omitted>
9/21/18, 11:13 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Once again, terrifying photos that I'm not sure I'm showing our kids!!!!
9/21/18, 11:13 AM - Hannah Guedenet: What in the world are you up to???
9/21/18, 11:19 AM - Hannah Guedenet: also just had a SUPER shitty conversation with Ana
9/21/18, 11:48 AM - Charles G: Boat tour was rainy. Now at a restaurant in a theme park
9/21/18, 11:49 AM - Charles G: What did she say?
9/21/18, 11:52 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Too much to go into
9/21/18, 11:52 AM - Hannah Guedenet: A theme park??? What a weird experience...
9/21/18, 12:40 PM - Charles G: Yeah
9/21/18, 12:40 PM - Charles G: They're serving coffee now. It's true! They do have coffee at all hours
9/21/18, 12:40 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Ha!
9/21/18, 1:55 PM - Charles G: <Media omitted>
9/21/18, 1:57 PM - Hannah Guedenet: It looks like it's in the middle of a construction site. Seriously your photos make it seem like you're in bizarro world
9/21/18, 2:01 PM - Charles G: <Media omitted>
9/21/18, 2:02 PM - Hannah Guedenet: still looks pyschodelic
9/21/18, 2:03 PM - Charles G: I had no time to walk around to get better photos. Also, the weather has not been super accommodating. The boat ride was crazy. The water level was so high that we had to duck to get under bridges. And it started pouring down rain halfway through. They handed out ponchos but not not before we were already wet
9/21/18, 2:03 PM - Hannah Guedenet: oh man that sounds awful
9/21/18, 2:03 PM - Hannah Guedenet: well i think something bad is happening at Tanager
9/21/18, 2:04 PM - Hannah Guedenet: seth signed off for the day after a long meeting with chiara and ana that i knew was going to be tough based on chiara's general feelings about things at the org
9/21/18, 2:04 PM - Hannah Guedenet: and chiara just skyped to say that the meeting ended with her "in tears sobbing against the wall"
9/21/18, 2:07 PM - Charles G: woah
9/21/18, 2:07 PM - Charles G: and you have no idea what it is??
9/21/18, 2:07 PM - Hannah Guedenet: seth has been pretty MIA for awhile and it's getting to be a challenge for people
9/21/18, 2:08 PM - Hannah Guedenet: and chiara is supposed to be coordinating with him on things but he totally bails and leaves her hanging ,then ana wants to know why things aren't getting done
9/21/18, 2:08 PM - Charles G: yeah, you mentioned that
9/21/18, 2:08 PM - Hannah Guedenet: chiara has reached her breaking point
9/21/18, 2:09 PM - Charles G: that seems really unlike him
9/21/18, 2:09 PM - Hannah Guedenet: who knows
9/21/18, 2:09 PM - Hannah Guedenet: she also wouldn't talk to him and express what kind of position he was putting her in
9/21/18, 2:09 PM - Hannah Guedenet: also it doesn't help that he makes $40k more than she does but ana tells her that they are at the same leve
9/21/18, 2:10 PM - Hannah Guedenet: level
9/21/18, 2:10 PM - Hannah Guedenet: and chiara has a masters
9/21/18, 2:10 PM - Hannah Guedenet: seth does not
9/21/18, 2:10 PM - Charles G: seth doesn't have a masters? interesting
9/21/18, 2:10 PM - Hannah Guedenet: nope
9/21/18, 2:10 PM - Charles G: $40k is a huge pay differential
9/21/18, 2:10 PM - Hannah Guedenet: yep
9/21/18, 2:11 PM - Charles G: I mean, there are always pay ranges within salary levels but I don't think they're usually that wide
9/21/18, 2:11 PM - Charles G: you guys don't even have set pay levels do you?
9/21/18, 2:11 PM - Hannah Guedenet: the thing is she is not the same grade as him, though ana considers her our CFO
9/21/18, 2:12 PM - Hannah Guedenet: it's really messed up
9/21/18, 2:12 PM - Charles G: oh, got it
9/21/18, 2:12 PM - Hannah Guedenet: what do you mean set pay levels?
9/21/18, 2:12 PM - Charles G: I mean pay grades
9/21/18, 2:12 PM - Hannah Guedenet: i would still like to understand why joe and i have such a big difference...
9/21/18, 2:12 PM - Hannah Guedenet: we do have grades
9/21/18, 2:12 PM - Hannah Guedenet: we follow AV's
9/21/18, 2:12 PM - Hannah Guedenet: seth got bumped up a grade
9/21/18, 2:12 PM - Charles G: OK. I understand now
9/21/18, 2:13 PM - Hannah Guedenet: but joe and i are in the same grade - and i think chiara is finally in the same grade as us but still getting paid less than us
9/21/18, 2:13 PM - Charles G: what was your shitty conversation with Ana about?
9/21/18, 2:13 PM - Hannah Guedenet: my other predicament - interviewed a comms dir candidate today. seems really good - has relevant experience and interviewed well. worked at H+ previously and got feedback from Anna Marie that "he no longer works for HarvestPlus and will never work for Harvestplus again"
9/21/18, 2:14 PM - Hannah Guedenet: he burned bridges
9/21/18, 2:14 PM - Charles G: wow
9/21/18, 2:14 PM - Hannah Guedenet: we had a check in -- and i shared with her that i had interviewed a possible team leader candidate for IGNITE . someone who fit the quals she told me she wanted in the position. she pulled up the CV and just ripped her apart
9/21/18, 2:15 PM - Charles G: did his experience at H+ come up during the interview?
9/21/18, 2:15 PM - Hannah Guedenet: then i brought up a conversation on how we need to make sure we are communicating to staff about our sexual harassament and discrimination policy - and she just tore into me. asking me all these questions about where the resources would come from and who was goign to be responsible for this
9/21/18, 2:16 PM - Charles G: sounds like you caught her in a really bad mood??
9/21/18, 2:16 PM - Hannah Guedenet: i guess it's more complicated than i realized but her way of discussing it with me was just so discouraging - totally accusatory and frankly demeaning
9/21/18, 2:17 PM - Charles G: yeah, I've always said I would have a hard time working for her
9/21/18, 2:17 PM - Hannah Guedenet: OH and i mentioned that Pete our comms consultant was really too heavy on AV and USG stuff on our twitter feed - her response "I looked through it and it's not bad" -- well, he linked to the AV annual report that doesn't mention us. at least 40% of the tweets in the past month are just direct retweets of AV stuff or USG stuff not relevant to us
9/21/18, 2:17 PM - Charles G: even if she has good qualities too
9/21/18, 2:18 PM - Hannah Guedenet: yeah - the conversation really turned me off to wanting to bring up things with her. and if that is what chiara deals with regularly, i can't even imagine
9/21/18, 2:19 PM - Charles G: yeah, it's completely deflating and demoralizing
9/21/18, 2:19 PM - Charles G: this sounds unrelated but it's not: I don't think I want to apply for other jobs anymore
9/21/18, 2:20 PM - Charles G: I have a very good boss who pays for me to go to conferences and learn. That's hard to find
9/21/18, 2:21 PM - Hannah Guedenet: it is true
9/21/18, 2:21 PM - Hannah Guedenet: but i think it is also ok to look for what you want to do next
9/21/18, 2:22 PM - Charles G: and there lies the tension. Be happy in the present or strive for new experiences and development
9/21/18, 2:23 PM - Hannah Guedenet: not strive
9/21/18, 2:23 PM - Hannah Guedenet: but identify areas that interest you
9/21/18, 2:26 PM - Charles G: yeah, that's a good place to start
9/21/18, 2:26 PM - Hannah Guedenet: i feel like the jobs you have been interested in are all over the place (especially that last one)
9/21/18, 2:27 PM - Hannah Guedenet: what is it you really want to be doing?
9/21/18, 2:27 PM - Hannah Guedenet: maybe take time to figure that out
9/21/18, 2:44 PM - Charles G: there are some commonalities among them. They've all involved more opportunity to deepen my research skills
9/21/18, 2:45 PM - Hannah Guedenet: true
9/21/18, 3:55 PM - Charles G: <Media omitted>
9/21/18, 4:12 PM - Charles G: ok, I should go to bed. I love you
9/21/18, 4:16 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Love you too. Sorry we didn't talk
9/21/18, 4:16 PM - Hannah Guedenet: No video for me???
9/21/18, 4:17 PM - Charles G: :)
9/21/18, 4:17 PM - Charles G: yeah, sending you a video too
9/21/18, 4:21 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Ahh thankd
9/21/18, 4:22 PM - Hannah Guedenet: <Media omitted>
9/21/18, 4:22 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Also are there outdoor plants I should be tendin?
9/21/18, 4:23 PM - Charles G: <Media omitted>
9/21/18, 4:23 PM - Charles G: It's suppose visit to rain tomorrow, right? They should be  ok
9/21/18, 4:25 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Not any more. It will rain Sunday
9/21/18, 4:41 PM - Charles G: Oh, then please water all the plants outside
9/21/18, 4:46 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Bummer
9/21/18, 4:46 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Will do
9/21/18, 4:47 PM - Charles G: it takes 5 minutes
9/21/18, 4:47 PM - Hannah Guedenet: You assume I have 5 mins...
9/21/18, 4:47 PM - Hannah Guedenet: I'll do it
9/21/18, 4:48 PM - Charles G: thank you. I truly appreciate it
9/21/18, 4:49 PM - Charles G: so do the trees
9/21/18, 8:58 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Oh and I watered the plants
9/21/18, 8:58 PM - Hannah Guedenet: <Media omitted>
9/22/18, 3:11 AM - Charles G: Thanks for the video :) nothing from the girls though?
9/22/18, 3:12 AM - Charles G: My session this morning went great. Good turnout and great feedback afterwards
9/22/18, 5:28 AM - Charles G: Hey, it's only 1:30 here but my phone is about to die and I forgot my charger. Just wanted to say good morning to you! Maybe we can talk tonight? bisous
9/22/18, 11:43 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Sorry the girls didn't send back a video. We had a crazy morning with lots to get done. Including French homeowkr which drives me nuts. I'm done trying to get them to do it. So glad your session went well. Not sure what time you'll be done. We could talk on the way home from french class. I have the beer festival tonight so won't be with the girls.
9/22/18, 11:43 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Dropped girls off at French class and I was super late.
9/22/18, 11:44 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Is Addie supposed to pick up a shirt today?
9/22/18, 11:44 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Going over to Erica's
9/22/18, 12:45 PM - Charles G: Hey there. Great day but kind of struck it this evening. I mapped out a walking tour of the city that would end at a bar with a huge swedish beer selection...but my phone stopped working when I left the hotel. I decided to just leave it to serendipity but that was a mistake. Walked an hour and found every possible ethnic cuisine but nothing local
9/22/18, 12:47 PM - Charles G: My phone mysteriously works now. I'm back at the hotel restaurent but it's super busy so I'm just waiting
9/22/18, 12:49 PM - Charles G: My flight tomorrow is at 6:10 which means I have to leave at 3am!! What was I thinking??
9/22/18, 1:03 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Sorry babe. Sounds like a rough evening...
9/22/18, 1:05 PM - Charles G: Not rough. Just disappointing.
9/22/18, 1:52 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Sorry
9/22/18, 1:52 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Getting girls. You around to talk in a few?
9/22/18, 2:02 PM - Charles G: Yep
9/22/18, 2:11 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Missed video call
9/22/18, 2:53 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Sad that I'm going to the beer fest without you
9/22/18, 3:32 PM - Hannah Guedenet: <Media omitted>
9/22/18, 6:16 PM - Hannah Guedenet: <Media omitted>
9/22/18, 7:10 PM - Hannah Guedenet: The bourbon cherries are incredible in an Oriental
9/22/18, 7:10 PM - Hannah Guedenet: And Addie is having a sleepover
9/22/18, 7:10 PM - Hannah Guedenet: I'm child free
9/22/18, 7:10 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Wish you were here. But figure you'll be up son
9/22/18, 7:10 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Soon
9/22/18, 7:10 PM - Hannah Guedenet: I'm sorry I
9/22/18, 7:10 PM - Hannah Guedenet: I'm so drunk
9/22/18, 7:23 PM - Hannah Guedenet: I miss you
9/22/18, 7:23 PM - Hannah Guedenet: I do
9/22/18, 7:25 PM - Hannah Guedenet: And i love you
9/22/18, 7:57 PM - Charles G: I'm jealous. This trip wasn't nearly as relaxing or as fun as I'd imagined it would be
9/22/18, 7:57 PM - Hannah Guedenet: I'm sorry babe
9/22/18, 7:58 PM - Hannah Guedenet: You're missing a history lesson from Justin
9/22/18, 8:00 PM - Charles G: Hahaha
9/22/18, 8:21 PM - Hannah Guedenet: I hate when we talk religion...
9/22/18, 8:39 PM - Charles G: Wish I was there. It's uncomfortable, esp with Justin, but its also weird not to talk with friends about something that's so important to us
9/22/18, 9:05 PM - Hannah Guedenet: He is not convinced that you know don't about fortnite..
9/22/18, 9:06 PM - Charles G: The video game? Yes, I know abut it. Jack can do one of the dances
9/22/18, 9:09 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Yes. That's the extent of your knowledge
9/22/18, 9:09 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Aubin plays it. And Justin says it's a cultural phenomenon
9/22/18, 9:09 PM - Hannah Guedenet: I'm so dunk
9/22/18, 9:09 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Drunk
9/22/18, 9:10 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Wish you were here.
9/22/18, 9:10 PM - Hannah Guedenet: This sucks
9/22/18, 9:10 PM - Hannah Guedenet: And I'm in an empty house. This is weird
9/22/18, 9:13 PM - Charles G: Aubin plays it? I know that he does video games.
9/22/18, 9:13 PM - Charles G: Nobody has ever been able to make a compelling case for why I should get into video games (well, not since I was a kid)
9/22/18, 9:14 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Talk to Aubin and Justin
9/22/18, 9:14 PM - Hannah Guedenet: I miss you
9/22/18, 9:14 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Seriously this is the worst way the end a night. Drunk and alone.
9/22/18, 9:14 PM - Hannah Guedenet: You're going to be exhausted when you get home
9/22/18, 9:14 PM - Charles G: i'd be curious how many girls/women play fortnite.
9/22/18, 9:15 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Babe...we need the figure out shit out
9/22/18, 9:15 PM - Hannah Guedenet: That should have read we need to figure our shit out
9/22/18, 9:15 PM - Charles G: oh man. I'm sorry. That would suck. Can't be worse than how I finished my day yesterday.
9/22/18, 9:16 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Seriously. We need to figure things out
9/22/18, 9:16 PM - Charles G: yeah, definitely.
9/22/18, 9:17 PM - Charles G: I'm looking forward to having someone to talk to about our stuff
9/22/18, 9:17 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Someone meaning a therapist??
9/22/18, 9:17 PM - Charles G: Not sure how couples therapy works though. Do we need to prep about what topics/issue we want to talk about or does the therapist start with more general questions? I know this is your first time too...I'm just wondering
9/22/18, 9:18 PM - Charles G: yeah, the therapist of course
9/22/18, 9:18 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Questions I have are around when we will go and how we'll pay for it. Not sure it is covered by insurance.
9/22/18, 9:18 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Like will you take off work
9/22/18, 9:19 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Can we go on Fridays?
9/22/18, 9:19 PM - Charles G: I figured we would go on Fridays when we're both at home. We'll have to take leave...
9/22/18, 9:19 PM - Hannah Guedenet: And I think we talk about our inability to communicate
9/22/18, 9:19 PM - Charles G: I don't want to pay a babysitter so that we can go so during work hours is the only option
9/22/18, 9:19 PM - Hannah Guedenet: K
9/22/18, 9:20 PM - Hannah Guedenet: We have sick leave we can us
9/22/18, 9:20 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Use
9/22/18, 9:20 PM - Charles G: yeah
9/22/18, 9:20 PM - Hannah Guedenet: And it's important
9/22/18, 9:20 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Even if it costs us money
9/22/18, 9:20 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Right?
9/22/18, 9:20 PM - Charles G: yes
9/22/18, 9:20 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Ok
9/22/18, 9:20 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Glad we're on the same page
9/22/18, 9:20 PM - Charles G: yes, I said I was looking forward to it didn't I?
9/22/18, 9:20 PM - Hannah Guedenet: No.
9/22/18, 9:21 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Never heard you were looking forward to it
9/22/18, 9:21 PM - Charles G: yes, I did. Scroll up.
9/22/18, 9:21 PM - Hannah Guedenet: I thought you were grudgingly doing it
9/22/18, 9:21 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Oh ok. In this conversation you said that. Not previously
9/22/18, 9:22 PM - Charles G: everytime you've brought it up, I've agreed that it's important and everytime you say you don't believe me
9/22/18, 9:23 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Well you haven't done anything to make it happen
9/22/18, 9:23 PM - Hannah Guedenet: I emailed Roger to get a reference
9/22/18, 9:23 PM - Charles G: neither of us have until now
9/22/18, 9:23 PM - Charles G: Yeah, I saw your email. Thanks. I responded to him to say thanks
9/22/18, 9:24 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Yes you did respond to him
9/22/18, 9:24 PM - Charles G: ?
9/22/18, 9:24 PM - Hannah Guedenet: I need to sleep
9/22/18, 9:24 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Before this goes downhill
9/22/18, 9:24 PM - Hannah Guedenet: I'm drunk. Nothing good will come of this
9/22/18, 9:26 PM - Charles G: ok. Good night. love you
9/22/18, 9:28 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Love you too
9/22/18, 9:36 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Travel safw
9/22/18, 9:36 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Safe
9/22/18, 9:41 PM - Charles G: Ok. Going to board soon. Sleep well.
9/22/18, 9:49 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Thanks. I may have mentioned something in my drunken state about moving to France...
9/22/18, 9:49 PM - Hannah Guedenet: I can't remember
9/22/18, 9:49 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Night
9/22/18, 9:51 PM - Charles G: Oh. That's ok.
9/22/18, 9:51 PM - Charles G: Aubin will probably forget
9/23/18, 5:38 AM - Hannah Guedenet: No he didn't forget. Just texted asking if we are moving next month
9/23/18, 5:40 AM - Hannah Guedenet: What time is your flight?
9/23/18, 5:40 AM - Hannah Guedenet: And damn I was drunk
9/23/18, 5:40 AM - Charles G: Oh man. Well, he did say once that he and Kozue kind of expect us to move eventually so they just want to enjoy the time they have with us
9/23/18, 5:40 AM - Charles G: On the plane now. Huge plane
9/23/18, 5:41 AM - Charles G: It was slightly delayed.
9/23/18, 5:43 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Ok so you'll get home later than expected
9/23/18, 5:46 AM - Charles G: I don't know. Sometimes they can make up for lost time.
9/23/18, 5:46 AM - Hannah Guedenet: J
9/23/18, 5:46 AM - Hannah Guedenet: K
9/23/18, 5:47 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Btw I didn't forget to add your Cleveland dates to the list...I didn't have them because they're not on our calendar!
9/23/18, 5:47 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Way to throw me under the bus
9/23/18, 5:48 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Also you're coming home to rain tonight and tomorrow
9/23/18, 5:49 AM - Charles G: Sorry, I can take blame for it
9/23/18, 5:49 AM - Charles G: They're on the calendar now
9/23/18, 5:49 AM - Hannah Guedenet: No it's just crappy when I take time to send the list to your parents and you respond with Hannah forgot to include this one...
9/23/18, 5:49 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Thanks for putting on the calendar
9/23/18, 5:51 AM - Charles G: Really sorry. Not my intention to make you look bad. Just wanted to point out that a trip was missing.
9/23/18, 5:52 AM - Charles G: I'm also incredibly tired... Having trouble focusing
9/23/18, 5:52 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Maybe you'll be able to get some sleep..
9/23/18, 5:53 AM - Hannah Guedenet: ...
9/23/18, 5:56 AM - Charles G: Maybe
9/23/18, 5:58 AM - Charles G: It's raining in Paris now. I have the rain curse. It follows me everywhere
9/23/18, 5:58 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Apparently
9/23/18, 6:00 AM - Hannah Guedenet: I wasn't saying you should respond to your parents...
9/23/18, 6:00 AM - Charles G: I know. I wanted to.
9/23/18, 6:00 AM - Hannah Guedenet: NOW it looks like I said something to you. Which I did but still!
9/23/18, 6:01 AM - Charles G: Does it? I don't know. I should stop writing emails until I have more sleep
9/23/18, 6:02 AM - Hannah Guedenet: So October 6 is the harvest festival
9/23/18, 6:02 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Appreciate you thinking about it
9/23/18, 6:03 AM - Hannah Guedenet: I also kind of what to spend the 8th by myself...I know that sounds awful. Maybe I'll feel differently when the time comes.
9/23/18, 6:04 AM - Charles G: Ok. We can talk about it at home.
9/23/18, 6:05 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Ok
9/23/18, 6:06 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Aea is not on the calendar
9/23/18, 6:06 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Is your plane ever leaving???
9/23/18, 6:07 AM - Charles G: We're moving
9/23/18, 6:07 AM - Hannah Guedenet: K fly safe

9/23/18, 6:08 AM - Charles G: Yes
9/23/18, 1:51 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Ugh your plane is so late!!
9/23/18, 2:56 PM - Charles G: Yeah, I know. Just landed!!
9/23/18, 2:57 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Oh good
9/23/18, 2:59 PM - Hannah Guedenet: I'm afraid K and A are mad at us
9/23/18, 2:59 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Or will not want to be friends with us
9/23/18, 3:01 PM - Charles G: Why???
9/23/18, 3:02 PM - Charles G: Because you talked about moving to France or something else?
9/23/18, 3:02 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Yeah
9/23/18, 3:03 PM - Charles G: The first thing? Move to France?
9/23/18, 3:05 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Yes moving to France
9/23/18, 3:05 PM - Hannah Guedenet: I feel like shit. I'm never drinking again
9/23/18, 3:05 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Like not just physically but mentally. I can't remember everything I said
9/23/18, 3:06 PM - Charles G: Yikes. That's scary
9/23/18, 3:09 PM - Charles G: Sorry you feel shitty. I don't feel great either but happy to be home
9/23/18, 3:11 PM - Hannah Guedenet: I can't remember the last time that air France flight was on time...it's always late
9/23/18, 3:15 PM - Charles G: Yeah, we were late leaving
9/23/18, 3:15 PM - Charles G: And I missed the first people mover...argh
9/23/18, 3:15 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Sorry. I just want you to be home
9/23/18, 3:16 PM - Charles G: There's a couple on the plane that was on the flight to Sweden with me too.
9/23/18, 3:17 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Charlotte wanted to the marshmallow experiment where you give a kid a marshmallow and tell them they can eat it now or if they wait 10 minutes they get two
9/23/18, 3:17 PM - Hannah Guedenet: So we did it with candy corn. They were both very patient
9/23/18, 3:18 PM - Charles G: She knew about the experiment already?
9/23/18, 3:22 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Heard about it on wow in the world. We're going for a rain walk
9/23/18, 3:24 PM - Charles G: Oh, cool
9/23/18, 3:24 PM - Charles G: Rain walk? Fun. It's cooked down quite a bit
9/23/18, 3:24 PM - Charles G: Cooled
9/23/18, 4:03 PM - Charles G: I'm in an Uber
9/23/18, 4:03 PM - Charles G: Traffic isn't bad
9/23/18, 4:04 PM - Hannah Guedenet: It doesn't get bad until you're on the beltway
9/23/18, 4:08 PM - Charles G: Yep. Spoke too soon. Accident
9/23/18, 4:09 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Lovely
9/23/18, 4:10 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Told the girls you'd be back before bedtime so gave you a big window
9/23/18, 4:12 PM - Charles G: Ok. His app is saying 30 minutes
9/23/18, 4:35 PM - Charles G: I'm on University
9/23/18, 4:37 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Cool
9/25/18, 3:00 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Did the therapist get back to you?
9/25/18, 3:22 PM - Charles G: Yeah, just responded on Skype
9/25/18, 3:59 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Can you respond here? I'm not on Skype
9/25/18, 4:02 PM - Charles G: She doesn't do couples therapy. I was really bummed. I need to see who else nearby is in network. I can call the other lady too
9/25/18, 4:11 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Oh man...
9/25/18, 4:12 PM - Hannah Guedenet: That sucks
9/25/18, 5:54 PM - Charles G: Hi
9/25/18, 5:54 PM - Charles G: Ignore that
9/25/18, 5:55 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Who you saying hi too?
9/25/18, 6:02 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Are girls expecting me home for bedtime?
9/25/18, 6:05 PM - Charles G: It was a typo
9/25/18, 6:06 PM - Charles G: What do u want me to tell them?
9/25/18, 6:07 PM - Hannah Guedenet: A typo to whom??
9/25/18, 6:07 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Tell them I'll give them kisses when I get home.
9/25/18, 6:07 PM - Hannah Guedenet: I'll leave in 10 mins
9/25/18, 6:07 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Not sure how long it will take me
9/25/18, 6:10 PM - Charles G: A typo to u, silly
9/25/18, 6:10 PM - Charles G: Ok, will tell them
9/25/18, 6:12 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Hmmm....
9/25/18, 6:18 PM - Charles G: Oh, good grief
9/25/18, 6:32 PM - Hannah Guedenet: I'm in a Lyft. Should be home by 9
9/25/18, 6:35 PM - Charles G: Ok. They're in bed
9/25/18, 6:36 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Nice work. Night go ok?
9/25/18, 6:36 PM - Hannah Guedenet: And thanks. I had a good time. Had a really good wine from trader Joe's. Next time we need to stock up, we should go to one of the DC locations

9/26/18, 6:29 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Missed voice call
9/26/18, 6:29 AM - Hannah Guedenet: I could drive you back to the metro and drop the kids off if that would help
9/26/18, 6:30 AM - Hannah Guedenet: I'm hopping in the shower
9/26/18, 6:31 AM - Charles G: Aubin is giving me ride back
9/26/18, 6:53 AM - Hannah Guedenet: You also seem to have taken Charlotte's lunch
9/26/18, 6:53 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Addie has two lunches
9/26/18, 6:54 AM - Hannah Guedenet: I don't think you can blame all of this on Addie
9/26/18, 6:54 AM - Charles G: I'm a mess...I have no words
9/26/18, 6:59 AM - Charles G: I could call kaa. Maybe they could drop it off at the main office for Charlotte to pick up?

9/26/18, 3:19 PM - Hannah Guedenet: i appreciate your contributions to our church
9/26/18, 3:19 PM - Hannah Guedenet: i feel like it's really the only thing we contribute substantially so thank you for the role you play
9/26/18, 3:20 PM - Charles G: Yeah, it's true. It's the least I can do to contribute
9/26/18, 3:21 PM - Hannah Guedenet: plus the christmas party makes it ALL worth it
9/26/18, 3:21 PM - Charles G: Haha
9/26/18, 3:23 PM - Hannah Guedenet: at least from my perspective
9/26/18, 3:26 PM - Charles G: No, the dinners are definitely the best part of the board experience. Plus, getting to know internal workings although that is tiring and tiresome too

10/1/18, 11:42 AM - Hannah Guedenet: interesting piece on how some of the basic brain development for kids starts super early - and kids from lower income classes and some minorities really miss out
10/1/18, 11:42 AM - Hannah Guedenet: inequality starts so young
10/1/18, 12:16 PM - Charles G: Yeah, I'll check it out

10/2/18, 2:43 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Bonnie was on panel. Turns out she's leading the ag-nut piece of the big MSNA project that fhi and AV were on. And harvestplus has funding to commercialize biofortified crops
10/2/18, 3:04 PM - Hannah Guedenet: What time you headed home?
10/2/18, 3:04 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Gotta get the house cleaned up
10/2/18, 3:04 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Oh shoot forgot to get cash for cleaners. Can you get $120 for me?
10/2/18, 3:15 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Or you could get some when you go to dinner with girls
10/2/18, 3:15 PM - Charles G: Leaving now. I'll get cash
10/2/18, 3:15 PM - Charles G: Oh, ok. That might be easier

10/3/18, 8:05 AM - Hannah Guedenet: i'm having a really hard time feeling compassion for Seth right now
10/3/18, 8:06 AM - Hannah Guedenet: nothing is saved on SP and i have no idea what invoices are paid or what should be piad
10/3/18, 8:06 AM - Hannah Guedenet: paid
10/3/18, 8:06 AM - Hannah Guedenet: and then i go to instagram and see pics of him on vacation, smiling
10/3/18, 3:40 PM - Charles G: Yeah, he really left you all in a lurch. I hope he recognizes that at least and can appreciate how much the team has had to do in his absence
10/3/18, 3:40 PM - Charles G: He risks burning some bridges at tanager
10/3/18, 3:57 PM - Charles G: I'm at takoma
10/3/18, 3:57 PM - Charles G: Where are you?
10/3/18, 3:59 PM - Hannah Guedenet: At school

10/4/18, 6:39 AM - Charles G: I backed into a parked car, coming out of drive way. Left a small scratch. Left a note with my number. I feel awful
10/4/18, 6:40 AM - Charles G: I was talking to Addie...and didn't see how close I was
10/4/18, 6:40 AM - Charles G: I hopw the car owner is reasonable
10/4/18, 6:52 AM - Hannah Guedenet: i'm sorry, babe
10/4/18, 6:52 AM - Hannah Guedenet: it is really close
10/4/18, 6:52 AM - Hannah Guedenet: it was bound to happen at some point
10/4/18, 7:20 AM - Hannah Guedenet: FYI - i signed you up to work the fire pit on saturday at the harvest festival
10/4/18, 8:18 AM - Charles G: Yeah, I know. You told me. Thanks
10/4/18, 10:36 AM - Hannah Guedenet: No I mentioned I was going to. I actually did it
10/4/18, 3:30 PM - Hannah Guedenet: So I think I can safely say this now. Seth is leaving. Just like I said. He's coming back part time through the end of the month
10/4/18, 3:38 PM - Charles G: Well, shit
10/4/18, 3:38 PM - Hannah Guedenet: And Ana suggested I move into some of his role....
10/4/18, 3:38 PM - Charles G: It's a bit unprofessional of him to leave like this
10/4/18, 3:41 PM - Hannah Guedenet: No response??
10/4/18, 3:41 PM - Charles G: And why take 2 weeks off now? It's just a weird way to end your time at a place you've been at for so long
10/4/18, 3:42 PM - Charles G: Oh, missed that message!!
10/4/18, 3:42 PM - Charles G: Wow
10/4/18, 3:42 PM - Charles G: Some of his role?
10/4/18, 3:43 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Yes
10/4/18, 3:43 PM - Hannah Guedenet: We can talk more
10/4/18, 3:44 PM - Hannah Guedenet: My head is spinning. I'm trying not to freak out what the next few months are going to be like

10/9/18, 9:36 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Also not everyone knows yet which is hard
10/9/18, 10:09 AM - Charles G: hey
10/9/18, 10:09 AM - Charles G: the next time you talk to him, it will be awkward
10/9/18, 10:09 AM - Hannah Guedenet: I'm in a Lyft with the slowest driver ever. And I didn't leave enough time
10/9/18, 10:17 AM - Charles G: 😲 how's traffic?
10/9/18, 10:19 AM - Hannah Guedenet: It's ok. I finally had to ask him to go faster. He was going 55 on 95 where the speed limit is 65
10/9/18, 10:22 AM - Hannah Guedenet: So it looks like my trip to Burkina will get pushed a week. Guess I could do the Guatemala thing

10/9/18, 10:56 AM - Hannah Guedenet: What the hell is wrong with her?
10/9/18, 11:08 AM - Hannah Guedenet: At the gate waiting to board
10/9/18, 11:12 AM - Charles G: I don't know. She doesn't believe you?
10/9/18, 11:12 AM - Hannah Guedenet: I hope she will
10/9/18, 11:15 AM - Charles G: yes, otherwise it's a waste
10/9/18, 11:18 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Emailed Matthew
10/9/18, 11:20 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Omg my arms are so sore

10/10/18, 3:19 PM - Hannah Guedenet: i assume that is what she meant when she told me they have lots of timeshare there...
10/10/18, 3:20 PM - Charles G: Haha.. Just the two of us?
10/10/18, 3:22 PM - Hannah Guedenet: YES!

10/10/18, 9:58 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Going to send a video but before I forget you just go onto chrome on the computer and the link to Liift 4 is saved on the bookmarks bar. The password for the computer is guinea76. We are week 3 day 3. Should be shoulders
10/10/18, 10:00 PM - Hannah Guedenet: And you shouldn't need it but sent you the Beachbody password via lastpass
10/11/18, 6:20 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Oh man I forgot to send a video. I will do it later this AM. Sorry!!! How was the workout??
10/11/18, 6:39 AM - Charles G: Workout was good! Glad I made myself get up... Wasn't easy
10/11/18, 6:39 AM - Charles G: Good dinner last night?
10/11/18, 7:31 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Yeah it was good dinner. Good company and food. Walked there and back. Ended up being about 4 miles...
10/11/18, 7:45 AM - Hannah Guedenet: can you reach out to your parents about the end of Oct?
10/11/18, 7:45 AM - Hannah Guedenet: it looks like i will be in Kenya 28 Oct - 3 Nov
10/11/18, 7:51 AM - Hannah Guedenet: actually i will just send your parents an email
10/11/18, 8:30 AM - Hannah Guedenet: doing the workout -- hope i don't piss off the people below...if there is anoyone there
10/11/18, 9:36 AM - Charles G: thanks for sending the email to my parents. The dates are fixed? I mean, there's no flexibility?
10/11/18, 9:36 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Nope the event is on the 30th. Malia might get a job doing the tutoring. And if she does, Kalai could come hopefully
10/11/18, 9:36 AM - Charles G: the swimming stroke exercise with weights is a killer
10/11/18, 9:36 AM - Charles G: ok
10/11/18, 9:36 AM - Hannah Guedenet: I did it without. I couldn't lift the resistance bands that high
10/11/18, 9:37 AM - Charles G: got it
10/11/18, 9:37 AM - Hannah Guedenet: I liked the workout.
10/11/18, 9:37 AM - Hannah Guedenet: I do not want to give this presentation...
10/11/18, 9:37 AM - Charles G: yeah, me too
10/11/18, 9:37 AM - Hannah Guedenet: And I still owe you a video...
10/11/18, 9:38 AM - Charles G: yep but don't worry about it now. Focus on you prez. You're gonna kill it like you always do!
10/11/18, 9:39 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Thanks babe. Your day going ok? You seemed pretty down when we talked yesterday
10/11/18, 10:05 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Missed video call
10/11/18, 10:09 AM - Hannah Guedenet: <Media omitted>
10/11/18, 10:09 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Oh my gosh what a horrible still from the video!!!
10/11/18, 11:22 AM - Hannah Guedenet: I'm going to vomit
10/11/18, 6:37 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Your mom seems to say they could watch the girls for us. Maybe call them tonight if you have a minute?
10/11/18, 8:53 PM - Charles G: <Media omitted>
10/11/18, 9:42 PM - Hannah Guedenet: <Media omitted>
10/12/18, 5:21 AM - Charles G: This mornings hit and core workouts are killers
10/12/18, 7:34 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Ugh. I think I'm going to do it when I get home. There are people in the apartment below me
10/12/18, 7:52 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Also I'm insanely sore this AM.
10/12/18, 7:52 AM - Hannah Guedenet: I still don't know what to do with the news your parents are moving to Frederick...
10/12/18, 7:52 AM - Charles G: my legs feel so weak
10/12/18, 7:53 AM - Hannah Guedenet: By back and shoulders hurt
10/12/18, 7:53 AM - Hannah Guedenet: And that's from yesterday
10/12/18, 7:53 AM - Charles G: I don't know if they'll actually move to Frederick. My mom has thrown around the idea of getting an apartment in the area before
10/12/18, 7:53 AM - Charles G: seems ridiculous to have so many houses that are empty most of the year
10/12/18, 7:54 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Oh this wasn't like...here's what we're doing. It was more we're thinking about this?
10/12/18, 7:54 AM - Hannah Guedenet: They wouldn't sell Florida?
10/12/18, 7:55 AM - Charles G: I felt like it was more just mom getting excited about the idea. They obviously would need to sell the house in Smithsburg first. Presumably, they would have to look at their finances first.
10/12/18, 7:55 AM - Charles G: My mom just said they would sell one of the florida properties but not both
10/12/18, 12:14 PM - Charles G: it's beautiful today!
10/12/18, 12:19 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Good!!!!
10/12/18, 12:19 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Getting ready to head to airport
10/12/18, 12:19 PM - Charles G: good morning...?
10/12/18, 12:20 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Ummm...
10/12/18, 12:20 PM - Hannah Guedenet: He said sorry
10/12/18, 12:20 PM - Hannah Guedenet: For all the work
10/12/18, 12:20 PM - Hannah Guedenet: He seems engaged now
10/12/18, 12:20 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Still never acknowledged anything is wrong
10/12/18, 12:20 PM - Charles G: ok
10/12/18, 12:21 PM - Charles G: did he say why he was leaving?
10/12/18, 12:21 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Nope
10/12/18, 12:21 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Just that it was time for him. And it's good for Tanager
10/12/18, 12:23 PM - Charles G: so the conversation wasn't particularly enlightening, I take it
10/12/18, 12:24 PM - Hannah Guedenet: No. I still like him as a person but this was still a shit move
10/12/18, 12:26 PM - Charles G: yeah
10/12/18, 1:32 PM - Hannah Guedenet: I just got really really tired
10/12/18, 1:52 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Hey
10/12/18, 1:52 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Are you going to Aldi today?
10/12/18, 2:14 PM - Hannah Guedenet: If so, can you get me lots of cans of pumpkin (like 6)? And make sure we have flour and eggs. I'll make pumpkin bread this weekend. Some for us and some for block party
10/12/18, 2:22 PM - Hannah Guedenet: On the plane. With two children in the row behind me.
10/12/18, 2:22 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Also something or someone smells very odd...
10/12/18, 2:22 PM - Hannah Guedenet: I love you. See you tonight. Give girls big hugs!
10/12/18, 3:33 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Have messaging on the plane.
10/12/18, 4:00 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Also save me some pizza. I'm going to be hungry when I get home
10/12/18, 4:34 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Wish I was there with y'all
10/12/18, 5:22 PM - Charles G: Me too!
10/12/18, 5:23 PM - Hannah Guedenet: What are girls watching??
10/12/18, 5:23 PM - Charles G: <Media omitted>
10/12/18, 5:23 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Oh man...can send messages but can't see photos. 😐
10/12/18, 5:23 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Looks like we might get in about 30 mins early

10/12/18, 5:27 PM - Charles G: Went to Aldi but no pumpkin. Sorry
10/12/18, 5:27 PM - Charles G: Also, Charlotte wanted Aldi Pizza so that's what we have
10/12/18, 5:31 PM - Hannah Guedenet: They didn't have any??
10/12/18, 5:31 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Oh man...
10/12/18, 5:31 PM - Hannah Guedenet: That does not sound very tasty
10/12/18, 5:37 PM - Hannah Guedenet: I just looked out my window and we're flying over the Mississippi River
10/12/18, 5:39 PM - Charles G: Cool
10/12/18, 6:35 PM - Hannah Guedenet: You should really listen to gogo penguin. So good!!
10/12/18, 6:35 PM - Hannah Guedenet: They are keeping me awake while I work on this flight...
10/12/18, 7:08 PM - Charles G: ooh, I like it

10/12/18, 7:48 PM - Hannah Guedenet: I'm at national. Don't get on beltway

10/29/18, 2:04 PM - Charles G: hey!!

10/29/18, 2:18 PM - Hannah Guedenet: I feel like that's my fault
10/29/18, 2:18 PM - Hannah Guedenet: You can't go after something you really want because of me
10/29/18, 2:18 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Please let's talk before you say no
10/29/18, 2:22 PM - Charles G: It's not you. It's everything. I'm weighing a lot of variables here. I've done the math in my head and it doesn't make sense but we can talk before I respond (and if they ask me)
10/29/18, 2:22 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Ok
10/29/18, 2:28 PM - Charles G: shoot. I forgot to scan your notebook. Can I just take pictures of them when I get home and send those to you?

10/29/18, 2:29 PM - Hannah Guedenet: No worries my fault for forgetting it
10/29/18, 2:29 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Don't forgot to print that sheet for your parents

10/29/18, 2:50 PM - Charles G: All the printers at work were not working...not even exaggerating. I will hand copy the sheet

10/29/18, 2:57 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Ok I'm going to bed
10/29/18, 2:57 PM - Hannah Guedenet: I love you
10/29/18, 2:57 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Give girls big hugs. Will send a video tomorrow.
10/29/18, 2:57 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Oh and has Charlotte's tooth still not come out??
10/29/18, 2:57 PM - Hannah Guedenet: There's probably the version I was working on in the recycling
10/29/18, 3:00 PM - Charles G: Nope. Still not out...her tooth
10/30/18, 2:08 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Hey sexy!! Hope you're up and getting ready for airport departure. I'm sure you're tired. Day going well so far. Just getting through some emails and setting up meetings for the week
10/30/18, 2:08 AM - Hannah Guedenet: I love you so much
10/30/18, 2:09 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Will respond to your email latee
10/30/18, 2:33 AM - Charles G: Yep. I'm in a taxi now. I really wish I'd gotten a later flight. But feeling ok overall. So nice to think I only have a 2 hour flight. Again, kind of wishing I had a domestic job with local travel only
10/30/18, 2:34 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Yeah this 7 hour time difference sucks. And 24 hours just traveling
10/30/18, 2:34 AM - Hannah Guedenet: You're flying out of iad. Probably good thing it's early
10/30/18, 2:35 AM - Hannah Guedenet: I slept horribly. Didn't go to bed until 1 and was afraid to take Ambien since I had to be up around 7ish. Woke up at 4 and couldn't sleep. And then didn't have enough time to do workout
10/30/18, 2:35 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Tomorrow will be better r
10/30/18, 2:37 AM - Charles G: Oh man. I'm sorry. Hang in there
10/30/18, 2:55 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Also you've been kind not to point it out but I have lots of gray hairs...
10/30/18, 2:56 AM - Charles G: No, just a few and only if you look
10/30/18, 2:57 AM - Charles G: You think you'll ever start dying your hair?
10/30/18, 3:09 AM - Hannah Guedenet: I don't think so
10/30/18, 3:16 AM - Hannah Guedenet: The weather is amazing. We should reconsider
10/30/18, 3:20 AM - Charles G: Haha
10/30/18, 3:22 AM - Charles G: Apparently, it's going to be rainy and cold the whole time I'm in Cleveland
10/30/18, 3:25 AM - Hannah Guedenet: You're not having much luck on the conference weather front. Good news is you spend most of the time inside
10/30/18, 3:31 AM - Charles G: Yeah, true. It's a slight 10 min walk from hotel to  center though. I may have buy a new umbrella
10/30/18, 3:31 AM - Hannah Guedenet: All the taxis are manuals. It's making me miss our little French car
10/30/18, 3:31 AM - Hannah Guedenet: That makes like number 5 in the past few months...
10/30/18, 3:55 AM - Charles G: I'm pretty sure Charlotte's will come out while we're both traveling. Last night, it was bleeding again during dinner...so close to coming out
10/30/18, 5:01 AM - Charles G: Ok. Going to take off soon. Love ya
10/30/18, 6:24 AM - Charles G: Already landed.
10/30/18, 6:24 AM - Charles G: By the way, Charlotte lost her tooth this morning! The little booger
10/30/18, 6:26 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Oh man!!
10/30/18, 6:26 AM - Hannah Guedenet: I always miss it
10/30/18, 6:26 AM - Hannah Guedenet: That was so fast. I'm jealous
10/30/18, 9:19 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Let's talk about IPA later
10/30/18, 9:19 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Do you have sessions today?
10/30/18, 10:15 AM - Charles G: No
10/30/18, 10:16 AM - Charles G: Starts tomorrow morning
10/30/18, 12:55 PM - Charles G: you gonna be able to talk tonight?
10/30/18, 12:59 PM - Hannah Guedenet: I'm on a call
10/30/18, 12:59 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Where are you?
10/30/18, 1:13 PM - Charles G: at the hotel but will be going out soonish
10/30/18, 1:15 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Ok give me 10 mins
10/30/18, 1:16 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Hopefully I'm wrapping this up
10/30/18, 1:16 PM - Charles G: ok. cool
10/30/18, 1:24 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Ok Ana is on now.
10/30/18, 1:24 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Hope we will be done in 5 mins
10/31/18, 3:59 AM - Hannah Guedenet: So I tried to do the work out this AM but doing triceps stuff with the bands was awful. And the chest presses just get replaced with push ups!! I ended up doing a short yoga video. Not sure I'll be able to keep up the next two weeks. I think I can do back and biceps and the legs. But shoulders was hard and today was impossible
10/31/18, 3:59 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Good morning by the way.
10/31/18, 4:00 AM - Hannah Guedenet: I miss you. Going to take a short nap before my evening of meetings begins
10/31/18, 4:18 AM - Charles G: hi
10/31/18, 4:18 AM - Charles G: I didn't do any workout this morning so hats off to you
10/31/18, 4:18 AM - Charles G: I'll get back into it tomorrow
10/31/18, 5:43 AM - Hannah Guedenet: have a great day babe! I LOVE YOU!
10/31/18, 9:34 AM - Hannah Guedenet: do your parents know the cleaners are coming today?
10/31/18, 10:33 AM - Charles G: it's in their hand written schedule we went over together and I pointed out the money envelope to BOTH of them
10/31/18, 10:39 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Ok cool. Thanks
10/31/18, 10:41 AM - Charles G: hey, I have a question for you
10/31/18, 10:42 AM - Charles G: What if I email the HR person at IPA and ask if I could ask some more questions about the position before moving on to the next step to help understand if my interests are a good fit?
10/31/18, 10:49 AM - Charles G: I'd like to know more about what the consultancy engagements consist of and what MEL needs clients have. 1) how much of this position is working with clients versus with IPA country teams or engaging in Unit strategy and development; 3) how long are work trips and do they foresee travel dropping to 15-20% at one point?
10/31/18, 10:59 AM - Hannah Guedenet: hmmm
10/31/18, 11:00 AM - Hannah Guedenet: i asked venu at lean data about them - she speaks very highly and new of the french guy who runs it (though doesn't know his name)
10/31/18, 11:02 AM - Hannah Guedenet: i don't really know if you can ask that at this point
10/31/18, 11:02 AM - Hannah Guedenet: it's still really early
10/31/18, 11:03 AM - Hannah Guedenet: seems like you have to get over this hurdle first
10/31/18, 11:03 AM - Charles G: ok
10/31/18, 11:03 AM - Hannah Guedenet: that's just my two cents
10/31/18, 11:03 AM - Charles G: just seems like they got to screen me but I didn't get to screen them
10/31/18, 11:03 AM - Hannah Guedenet: you've been thinking about it more?
10/31/18, 11:03 AM - Hannah Guedenet: that is true, but that was kind of the purpose
10/31/18, 11:04 AM - Charles G: yeah but now they're making me give up 2.5 hours of my time when I'm not even sure i want to work with them
10/31/18, 11:05 AM - Hannah Guedenet: i know
10/31/18, 11:06 AM - Charles G: French guy's name is Loic Watine https://www.linkedin.com/in/loic-watine-406b911a/
10/31/18, 11:07 AM - Hannah Guedenet: i should quit my job
10/31/18, 11:08 AM - Charles G: ??!!
10/31/18, 11:08 AM - Hannah Guedenet: damn - harvard and ecole polytechnique
10/31/18, 11:08 AM - Charles G: you like your job!
10/31/18, 11:08 AM - Hannah Guedenet: smart dude
10/31/18, 11:08 AM - Hannah Guedenet: i'm so tired
10/31/18, 11:08 AM - Charles G: yeah, real smart
10/31/18, 11:09 AM - Charles G: there's another M&E engagement manager based in NYC. He has less experience than me
10/31/18, 11:09 AM - Hannah Guedenet: benjamin
10/31/18, 11:09 AM - Hannah Guedenet: venu said she met with him and he's young
10/31/18, 11:09 AM - Hannah Guedenet: she suggested they are still trying to figure this out
10/31/18, 11:09 AM - Hannah Guedenet: but it's really exciting time to join
10/31/18, 11:18 AM - Hannah Guedenet: you still there?
10/31/18, 11:18 AM - Hannah Guedenet: thoughts?
10/31/18, 11:20 AM - Hannah Guedenet: did you work with lisa swann at pact?
10/31/18, 11:25 AM - Charles G: still here
10/31/18, 11:26 AM - Charles G: I'm familiar with the name but don't think I ever worked with her (Lisa swann). Why?
10/31/18, 11:26 AM - Hannah Guedenet: she applied for tanager
10/31/18, 11:26 AM - Hannah Guedenet: comsm jobs
10/31/18, 11:27 AM - Charles G: hahaha. Addie put whiskers on herself. She's getting so independent
10/31/18, 11:28 AM - Hannah Guedenet: it terrifies me
10/31/18, 11:28 AM - Hannah Guedenet: and makes me laugh at the same time
10/31/18, 11:29 AM - Hannah Guedenet: i need to go to sleep
10/31/18, 11:29 AM - Hannah Guedenet: i had food delivered - not good
10/31/18, 11:29 AM - Hannah Guedenet: and my stomach is all bloated and gross
10/31/18, 11:29 AM - Hannah Guedenet: going to try a new workout in the AM that Sara recommended - might push pause on Liift 4 until I'm back
10/31/18, 11:29 AM - Hannah Guedenet: and try something new
10/31/18, 11:31 AM - Charles G: ok. Sleep well. I need to eat better too. I will look for fruit and veggies tonight
10/31/18, 11:31 AM - Charles G: although may end meeting people at some mexican place
10/31/18, 11:31 AM - Hannah Guedenet: i miss you
10/31/18, 11:31 AM - Hannah Guedenet: a lot
10/31/18, 11:31 AM - Charles G: good luck on the workout
10/31/18, 11:31 AM - Charles G: love ya
10/31/18, 11:31 AM - Charles G: I miss you too!
10/31/18, 11:31 AM - Hannah Guedenet: sorry i can't send thoughtful emails in the evening
10/31/18, 11:31 AM - Hannah Guedenet: i'm just brain dead
10/31/18, 11:31 AM - Hannah Guedenet: also don't have a lot of time for deep relfection
10/31/18, 11:32 AM - Charles G: yeah, I understand. I have had more down time
10/31/18, 10:29 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Tried a new workout this AM. Didn't love it. Lots of moves that felt awkward and went fast. Plus the woman's voice annoyed me and there was obnoxious music. I miss Joel.
11/1/18, 7:09 AM - Hannah Guedenet: we now have a telework policy
11/1/18, 7:09 AM - Hannah Guedenet: france here we come! :)
11/1/18, 7:20 AM - Charles G: yay!!
11/1/18, 7:20 AM - Charles G: wait, moving to france or just long summers in France?
11/1/18, 7:20 AM - Hannah Guedenet: i technically already fall under it
11/1/18, 7:20 AM - Hannah Guedenet: it's 24 hours or more a week
11/1/18, 7:20 AM - Charles G: oh, ok
11/1/18, 7:21 AM - Hannah Guedenet: we could definitely do long summer
11/1/18, 7:21 AM - Hannah Guedenet: s
11/1/18, 7:21 AM - Hannah Guedenet: i am a teleworker - i could tehcnically work from anywhere
11/1/18, 7:21 AM - Charles G: Aleks is driving me crazy with the indicators. I just spent an hour drafting a very  long message about why he's wrong. Such a waste of my time. He might just push me off the edge and into a new job if this continues.
11/1/18, 7:22 AM - Hannah Guedenet: oh babe
11/1/18, 7:22 AM - Hannah Guedenet: i'm sorry
11/1/18, 7:22 AM - Hannah Guedenet: did you respond to IPA?
11/1/18, 7:24 AM - Charles G: yeah, i thought i sent you a message earlier. I'm taking the assessment next Tuesday
11/1/18, 7:25 AM - Charles G: ok. off to sessions. talk to you later!
11/1/18, 7:25 AM - Hannah Guedenet: oh good
11/1/18, 9:14 AM - Hannah Guedenet: oh btw...we're adopting an elephant
11/1/18, 9:14 AM - Hannah Guedenet: and i'm going to see them on Saturday
11/1/18, 9:14 AM - Hannah Guedenet: https://www.sheldrickwildlifetrust.org/index.asp
11/1/18, 9:15 AM - Hannah Guedenet: kenya would be a very fun place to come with the girls
11/1/18, 9:15 AM - Hannah Guedenet: maybe we can do that on one of my work trips here over the next 5 years...
11/1/18, 10:13 AM - Charles G: Cool. I've always wanted my own elephant!
11/1/18, 10:14 AM - Charles G: Wow, 5 years...
11/1/18, 10:29 AM - Hannah Guedenet: what do you mean?
11/1/18, 10:31 AM - Charles G: Crazy to think that you'll be on this project and traveling to Kenya for the next 5 yrs, don't you think?
11/1/18, 10:32 AM - Hannah Guedenet: oh yeah
11/1/18, 10:32 AM - Hannah Guedenet: especially with a 7/8 hour time different
11/1/18, 10:32 AM - Hannah Guedenet: difference
11/1/18, 10:32 AM - Hannah Guedenet: i'm going to start having early calls
11/1/18, 10:32 AM - Charles G: I mean, you've never been on the same project for 5 years
11/1/18, 10:32 AM - Charles G: Ugh
11/1/18, 10:41 AM - Hannah Guedenet: it's crazy but i've been on selever 3.5...
11/1/18, 10:41 AM - Hannah Guedenet: i started in 2015
11/1/18, 10:42 AM - Hannah Guedenet: how are sessions going?
11/1/18, 10:46 AM - Charles G: going alright. I went to couple disappointing sessions but that's normal. I have some exciting ones coming up, I think
11/1/18, 10:47 AM - Hannah Guedenet: cool
11/1/18, 10:47 AM - Hannah Guedenet: you're not presenting this year?
11/1/18, 10:48 AM - Charles G: I'm part of Joy's session tomorrow but she's leading. It's so nice to be presentation free!!
11/1/18, 1:39 PM - Charles G: you asleep yet?
11/1/18, 1:40 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Watching TV
11/1/18, 1:44 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Something up?
11/1/18, 1:47 PM - Charles G: no, just asking. how did your 4 hours of meetings and calls go?
11/1/18, 1:49 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Fine. I'm feeling overwhelmed. And I'm hungry. I haven't eaten thing I've really enjoyed.
11/1/18, 1:49 PM - Hannah Guedenet: I'm just grumpy. I should sleep
11/1/18, 1:54 PM - Charles G: It's been a long day for you. Yes, you should sleep.
11/1/18, 1:55 PM - Charles G: I love you
11/1/18, 1:59 PM - Hannah Guedenet: I love you too. And miss you
11/1/18, 10:58 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Hey babe. Sounds like you had a fun evening.
11/1/18, 10:59 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Got up and did a new workout this AM. It was super hard but at least didn't have the stupid music. Think I'll try and do the rest of week 6 while I'm here then do week 7 when I'm back. Never realized how much I enjoy Joel and the lifting
11/2/18, 2:34 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Omg Kenya is so different from West Africa. The grocery store was amazing. So many cool local options. I got some moringa tea. Can't wait to try it. Also the wine is very reasonable. I got a Chilean white for $10
11/2/18, 2:34 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Actually less than 10
11/2/18, 3:50 AM - Charles G: Hey there
11/2/18, 3:52 AM - Charles G: I'm so impressed that you're sticking with the workouts. I'm really not motivated. I can't say I miss Joel.
11/2/18, 4:04 AM - Charles G: You rethinking a move a Kenya one day! You seem to really like it
11/2/18, 4:04 AM - Charles G: That was suppose to be a ? Not a !
11/2/18, 4:25 AM - Hannah Guedenet: it's funny - i really feel better when i stick to my routine. been doing workouts and centering prayer each morning. part of me wants to sleep in, but then i tell myself i will feel better after i'm done. it's my hour of self-care each day
11/2/18, 4:25 AM - Hannah Guedenet: i'm surprising myself too
11/2/18, 4:25 AM - Hannah Guedenet: and i don't think I'm rethinking Kenya - it's nice but I wouldn't want to live here (and apparently getting a work permit is a nightmare)
11/2/18, 4:26 AM - Hannah Guedenet: but i am more open to Ouaga or somewhere in West Africa. but it is the whole thing of not wanting to force the situation. if something comes up, we should explore it
11/2/18, 4:27 AM - Hannah Guedenet: oh also - lydia drove me through Kibera (the slums) the other day. i think she was expecting me to be shocked by the poverty, but it looked like Ouaga. she talked about people living on $5 a day... i know it is a poor and the conditions are awful but that's the case in a lot of cities in west africa. maybe it's just that in kenya it is such a huge concentration of people
11/2/18, 4:43 AM - Charles G: interesting that poor neighborhoods in Nairobi look like most neighborhoods in Ouaga
11/2/18, 4:43 AM - Charles G: in other parts of west africa
11/2/18, 4:43 AM - Charles G: Kibera is pretty well known for its poverty too
11/2/18, 4:44 AM - Hannah Guedenet: yeah - it's also just super dense with people
11/2/18, 4:44 AM - Hannah Guedenet: which makes it worse
11/2/18, 4:47 AM - Hannah Guedenet: hey did you watch the new sabrina show on netflix?
11/2/18, 4:51 AM - Charles G: no, never heard of it
11/2/18, 4:52 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Ok that's weird. Maybe Malia had signed in as me
11/2/18, 4:57 AM - Hannah Guedenet: i want to so desperately to have a satisfying poop
11/2/18, 4:57 AM - Hannah Guedenet: i feel blcoked
11/2/18, 4:57 AM - Hannah Guedenet: and bloated
11/2/18, 5:01 AM - Charles G: Eating enough salad and fiber?
11/2/18, 5:01 AM - Hannah Guedenet: i've had a few salads
11/2/18, 5:01 AM - Hannah Guedenet: i don't think i brought my fiber pouches with me - i should look in my stuff
11/2/18, 6:19 AM - Hannah Guedenet: so i did the calculation the other day of what a 4% increase would be for me - that's just a merit increase. it takes me up to $97,500 - that is insane!
11/2/18, 6:20 AM - Hannah Guedenet: and looking at the salary bans, i will be eligible to move up to the next grade within next 1-2 years
11/2/18, 7:02 AM - Hannah Guedenet: **bands not bans
11/2/18, 7:02 AM - Hannah Guedenet: and that was short lived: https://dcist.com/story/18/11/02/i-mean-what-a-season-dc-united-eliminated-from-playoffs-after-mid-season-comeback/
11/2/18, 7:03 AM - Charles G: Almost up to 6 figures!!
11/2/18, 7:03 AM - Charles G: Yeah, heard on NPR
11/2/18, 7:04 AM - Charles G: Too bad
11/2/18, 7:06 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Isn't that insane? and in all honesty, i'll be pissed if I don't get some boost beyond merit. this year has been tough and i've done a lot. but i am not going to ask for it. i am going to ask her to officially change my title. it's nutrition specialist which is not what i am
11/2/18, 7:06 AM - Hannah Guedenet: you doing ok?
11/2/18, 7:07 AM - Charles G: Yeah, I use to refer to wealthy people as having six figure something as salaries but looks like we're both within reach of it
11/2/18, 7:08 AM - Hannah Guedenet: yeah
11/2/18, 7:09 AM - Charles G: Doing well. Last night was fun. Hung out with a bunch of DC international Dev people in a dive bar
11/2/18, 7:10 AM - Hannah Guedenet: nice
11/2/18, 7:10 AM - Charles G: And joy actually have me good advice on how to deal with aleks
11/2/18, 7:10 AM - Hannah Guedenet: wow
11/2/18, 7:10 AM - Hannah Guedenet: that's great
11/2/18, 7:10 AM - Hannah Guedenet: what was it
11/2/18, 7:12 AM - Charles G: To ask questions more because his thinking and rationale is so opaque and to always talk about how will support strategy goals, not programs. He seems to have a weird knee jerk reaction whenever you talk about working with programs team
11/2/18, 7:13 AM - Hannah Guedenet: huh that does sound helpful
11/2/18, 7:13 AM - Hannah Guedenet: oh telework policy states i can get 50% of internet costs reimbursed
11/2/18, 7:14 AM - Hannah Guedenet: yay - $25 a month for us!
11/2/18, 7:14 AM - Hannah Guedenet: date night!
11/2/18, 7:15 AM - Charles G: Nice!
11/2/18, 7:22 AM - Hannah Guedenet: oh and my per diem for this trip - $1500
11/2/18, 7:23 AM - Hannah Guedenet: $120 a day
11/2/18, 7:34 AM - Charles G: not bad at all. And just think of all the Kenya trips you'll be taking over the next 5 years
11/2/18, 7:35 AM - Hannah Guedenet: ugh
11/2/18, 7:35 AM - Hannah Guedenet: just fyi i donated $10 to an AV HR manager who lost her house and everything in it in a fire
11/2/18, 7:35 AM - Charles G: we should schedule a date night every 3 weeks and just put it on the calendar
11/2/18, 7:35 AM - Hannah Guedenet: she has two young kids
11/2/18, 7:35 AM - Hannah Guedenet: i know and find a regular babysitter
11/2/18, 7:35 AM - Hannah Guedenet: i just feel like nov/dec are going to be crazy
11/2/18, 7:36 AM - Hannah Guedenet: think i'll take a short nap - enjoy your sessions
11/2/18, 7:38 AM - Charles G: ok
11/2/18, 7:38 AM - Charles G: ttyl
11/2/18, 11:40 AM - Hannah Guedenet: I've been watching Jane the Virgin and not getting work done...
11/2/18, 11:46 AM - Hannah Guedenet: And I forgot to get Elise a birthday present...
11/2/18, 11:47 AM - Hannah Guedenet: And Chloe's dad will email you. He wants to set up date with Charlotte on Tuesday. You can say no
11/2/18, 12:03 PM - Charles G: Ok. Thanks
11/2/18, 12:03 PM - Charles G: Want me to buy present for Elise? I can buying thinking putty on Amazon
11/2/18, 12:04 PM - Charles G: That's what she got Charlotte

11/7/18, 10:15 AM - Hannah Guedenet: i ended up talking to my chiara and bursting into tears
11/7/18, 10:15 AM - Hannah Guedenet: i feel so much pressure
11/7/18, 10:47 AM - Charles G: oh gosh. I'm sorry hun!!!
11/7/18, 10:47 AM - Charles G: what happened? Why was it so bad?
11/7/18, 10:54 AM - Hannah Guedenet: i just felt like they asked questions i couldn't come up with solutions to
11/7/18, 10:54 AM - Hannah Guedenet: i emailed chiara our PO and apologized for my slow brain
11/7/18, 10:54 AM - Hannah Guedenet: i'm also just feeling so much pressure to make sure this work
11/7/18, 10:54 AM - Hannah Guedenet: works
11/7/18, 10:54 AM - Hannah Guedenet: and don't know if i can do it
11/7/18, 10:54 AM - Hannah Guedenet: how's your day going?
11/7/18, 12:46 PM - Charles G: Sorry, babe. Off to state Dept for a meeting. Had midyear review with Jill and letting with akeks about indicators. Phew
11/7/18, 12:47 PM - Charles G: Meeting, not letting
11/7/18, 12:54 PM - Hannah Guedenet: <Media omitted>
11/7/18, 12:55 PM - Hannah Guedenet: <Media omitted>
11/7/18, 1:00 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Oh I'm also upset because I ended up breaking down with Chiara. And then just mocked me for being silly that I can't get ignite to work and said we've all be there. It was less than helpful
11/7/18, 1:00 PM - Hannah Guedenet: And my head hurts so badly
11/7/18, 1:12 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Here's another idea. You get that IPA job. We move to France. I quit my job and just be an editor or something that doesn't require travel or any high level of responsibility for me. Would that work for you???
11/7/18, 3:11 PM - Charles G: Phew, finally can rest and catch up wityour messages
11/7/18, 3:11 PM - Charles G: On the metro now
11/7/18, 3:18 PM - Charles G: Totally normal to feel overwhelmed/stressed on ignite. Startup for any program is stressful but it's especially so for one this size. Once you have staff hired and a team you trust to work with, you can share the stress and responsibility with them. I just hope you don't kill yourself in the process...
11/7/18, 3:19 PM - Charles G: Sorry we didn't get a chance to really talk today. Hope you get some sleep. Love you
11/7/18, 9:10 PM - Charles G: <Media omitted>
11/7/18, 9:10 PM - Charles G: <Media omitted>
11/7/18, 9:10 PM - Charles G: One of these times, I won't be in my undershirt and in bed
11/7/18, 9:10 PM - Charles G: Sorry for rambling
11/7/18, 9:29 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Nice work on a successful dinner. And you kept doing this weird sucking noise with your teeth while talking to me...
11/7/18, 9:30 PM - Hannah Guedenet: I was up at 6:30 because they must have had an exercise class. Lots of pounding and music. Ugh I'm so ready to come home.
11/7/18, 9:35 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Thanks for the video. I think we both need to sit down and really evaluate our jobs and what we want right now.
11/7/18, 9:41 PM - Hannah Guedenet: You had socks on your list. Any specifications on those?
11/8/18, 4:10 AM - Charles G: Hey
11/8/18, 4:11 AM - Charles G: Running socks or work socks. I need both
11/8/18, 4:35 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Morning babe
11/8/18, 4:47 AM - Hannah Guedenet: I have taken Uber all over Nairobi. It's cheap and super easy. Don't think I'd told you that.
11/8/18, 4:47 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Also did some Christmas shopping.
11/8/18, 5:00 AM - Charles G: Cool. Isn't traffic awful in Nairobi?
11/8/18, 5:00 AM - Hannah Guedenet: It's been as bad as I remembered from my last visit. Depends on where you're going and when. Much like DC.
11/8/18, 5:00 AM - Hannah Guedenet: **not
11/8/18, 5:01 AM - Hannah Guedenet: I could see why people like living here
11/8/18, 5:11 AM - Charles G: I wish I could visit with you
11/8/18, 6:27 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Yeah me too
11/8/18, 6:53 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Oh. Can we talk during Charlotte's appointment???
11/8/18, 6:53 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Or would that be weird? You could ask Mrs Buckley
11/8/18, 7:02 AM - Charles G: I can ask
11/8/18, 7:24 AM - Charles G: Shit. What's their address??
11/8/18, 7:24 AM - Hannah Guedenet: 12501 Prosperity Drive, Suite 100
Silver Spring , MD  20904
11/8/18, 7:31 AM - Hannah Guedenet: You find it?
11/8/18, 7:31 AM - Hannah Guedenet: You do realize how many times we've been there over the past SEVEN years...
11/8/18, 7:36 AM - Charles G: I thought they had moved!!
11/8/18, 7:37 AM - Hannah Guedenet: That's the dentist
11/8/18, 7:37 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Are you there??
11/8/18, 7:37 AM - Hannah Guedenet: You're going to the Ms Buckley
11/8/18, 7:38 AM - Hannah Guedenet: I hope you're there because if you're past 10 mins late they make you reschedule
11/8/18, 7:39 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Ohhhh! And you have to get a note from the office saying she was at the appointment to give to the shcool when you drop her off
11/8/18, 7:50 AM - Charles G: Charlotte is getting weighed and stuff
11/8/18, 7:50 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Suspense is killing me. It's like a cliff hanger!
11/8/18, 7:50 AM - Hannah Guedenet: K
11/8/18, 7:50 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Phew
11/8/18, 7:50 AM - Hannah Guedenet: I wish I was there
11/8/18, 7:50 AM - Charles G: Yeah...phew
11/8/18, 7:51 AM - Charles G: Ok about the note
11/8/18, 7:52 AM - Hannah Guedenet: The school gets quite testy about it
11/8/18, 8:41 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Still waiting for results?
11/8/18, 8:41 AM - Charles G: Yep
11/8/18, 8:42 AM - Charles G: I'm going to miss a meeting
11/8/18, 8:42 AM - Hannah Guedenet: I'm so sorry hub
11/8/18, 8:42 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Hun

11/8/18, 8:48 AM - Charles G: Blue Cross, blue shield right?
11/8/18, 8:48 AM - Hannah Guedenet: No babe. Carefiest
11/8/18, 8:48 AM - Hannah Guedenet: You shouldn't have to do anything though
11/8/18, 8:48 AM - Hannah Guedenet: We don't pay for welll visits
11/8/18, 8:50 AM - Charles G: I know but they asked for my insurance card
11/8/18, 8:50 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Oh
11/8/18, 8:50 AM - Charles G: Also, no strep!!
11/8/18, 8:50 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Phew!
11/8/18, 10:26 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Did c end up getting her flu shot?
11/8/18, 10:28 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Also nytimes is only $1 a week for a year. We should sign up
11/8/18, 10:28 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Only good for today
11/8/18, 10:37 AM - Hannah Guedenet: In taxi headed to airport
11/8/18, 11:56 AM - Charles G: yeah, she got her flu shot
11/8/18, 11:56 AM - Charles G: no tears
11/8/18, 11:57 AM - Charles G: NYT is always having deals. Why don't we ask for a subscription for Christmas?
11/8/18, 11:57 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Ok
11/8/18, 11:57 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Re nytimes
11/8/18, 11:58 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Awesome. I'll take Addie next week
11/8/18, 11:58 AM - Hannah Guedenet: So proud of her
11/8/18, 11:58 AM - Hannah Guedenet: I'm sure she'll tell Addie not to be afraid...probably in her smarty pants way! 😁
11/8/18, 11:58 AM - Hannah Guedenet: I miss you
11/8/18, 12:02 PM - Charles G: I miss you too
11/8/18, 12:02 PM - Charles G: Yeah, Charlotte's such a know-it-all!
11/8/18, 12:08 PM - Hannah Guedenet: You told me in the video with your clucking! ❤️
11/8/18, 12:08 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Oops. Meant 😂
11/8/18, 12:08 PM - Hannah Guedenet: How's your day going?
11/8/18, 12:11 PM - Charles G: yeah, I actually started over with a new video but I think I was waking Charlotte up so I stopped. I should record myself before I get too tired
11/8/18, 12:15 PM - Hannah Guedenet: You woke up Charlotte?? Doing what?
11/8/18, 12:16 PM - Hannah Guedenet: I do think you should talk to Jill and revise that 7 rating you have your job...
11/8/18, 12:16 PM - Charles G: I was talking so loud into the phone. I was in the bedroom next door
11/8/18, 12:16 PM - Charles G: All of a sudden I heard her yell out...not sure she remembers
11/8/18, 12:16 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Ahhh
11/8/18, 12:16 PM - Hannah Guedenet: I'm so ready to be home...
11/8/18, 12:17 PM - Charles G: really? I don't know. I'm so conflicted. This new work in Benin could be interesting
11/8/18, 12:19 PM - Hannah Guedenet: How's your day going?
11/8/18, 12:22 PM - Hannah Guedenet: True.
11/8/18, 12:22 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Are you still doing the education forum thing on Saturday?
11/8/18, 12:22 PM - Charles G: I have a lot to do and I'm tired
11/8/18, 12:23 PM - Charles G: yeah, doing the education forum. I'm looking forward to it. I've wanted to learn more about race equity in school systems
11/8/18, 12:25 PM - Charles G: The leaves of our magnolia are almost all down. You could make a leaf pile Saturday
11/8/18, 12:25 PM - Charles G: also, we need to put mulch into the chicken area...
11/8/18, 12:26 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Stupid chickens
11/8/18, 12:27 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Sadly I still have a lot to do. Was hoping I would get to take Monday off since it's technically a holiday. Not sure that will happen
11/8/18, 12:27 PM - Hannah Guedenet: I am sorry if this week has been stressful for you. I feel guilty
11/8/18, 12:34 PM - Hannah Guedenet: IREX has really bad reviews on Glassdoor...
11/8/18, 1:24 PM - Charles G: just had a meeting with martin about Syria...so tired of that project. We are now doing counter iran propaganda work
11/8/18, 1:25 PM - Charles G: really? Interesting. Makes me wonder if only people who want to complain leave reviews there
11/8/18, 1:25 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Wow
11/8/18, 1:25 PM - Hannah Guedenet: For what purpose?
11/8/18, 1:25 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Yeah I'm not sure how reliable Glassdoor is
11/8/18, 1:26 PM - Hannah Guedenet: On the plane.
11/8/18, 1:29 PM - Charles G: wow, just saw one IREX review that just slams them!! I would not want to work here if I saw some of these reviews
11/8/18, 1:29 PM - Hannah Guedenet: There is a very loud narrating mom. She's like 5 rows ahead of me and I can hear her
11/8/18, 1:29 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Toxic culture??
11/8/18, 1:30 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Toxic seemed like strong language
11/8/18, 1:31 PM - Charles G: yeah, that one
11/8/18, 1:31 PM - Hannah Guedenet: I know we're not super gushy about each other lately, but I just can't wait to be back in your arms, cuddled up with you in bed. I just want to be able to talk to you in person
11/8/18, 1:32 PM - Hannah Guedenet: I am realizing I just feel incomplete without you to talk with.
11/8/18, 1:32 PM - Charles G: 😍
11/8/18, 1:33 PM - Charles G: we'll be cuddling soon enough
11/8/18, 1:36 PM - Hannah Guedenet: I love you. I'm so thankful for you.
11/8/18, 1:36 PM - Hannah Guedenet: And you can make teriyaki Crock-Pot chicken. I'm so impressed. Seriously impressed!
11/8/18, 1:45 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Empty seat next to me!!! Score!
11/8/18, 1:54 PM - Charles G: yeah, i had it as a leftover and it was so good
11/8/18, 1:54 PM - Charles G: yay!
11/8/18, 10:19 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Signing off. Love you.
11/9/18, 4:22 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Morning sexy!!!! I'm on my way home.
11/9/18, 4:22 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Waiting to board in Amsterdam
11/9/18, 4:22 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Well I was on my way home last night but now I'm much closer
11/9/18, 4:23 AM - Charles G: Yay
11/9/18, 4:23 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Also I shockingly slept most of the flight from Nairobi and then slept a few more hours in the yotel
11/9/18, 4:23 AM - Charles G: Can't wait
11/9/18, 4:23 AM - Hannah Guedenet: You sleep well?
11/9/18, 4:23 AM - Charles G: You sleep on the plane?
11/9/18, 4:24 AM - Charles G: Yeah, went to bed late but slept well
11/9/18, 4:24 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Yes I slept
11/9/18, 4:24 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Got pulled for random security screening...
11/9/18, 4:24 AM - Charles G: Oh, sorry
11/9/18, 4:24 AM - Hannah Guedenet: But means I get to board first.
11/9/18, 4:25 AM - Hannah Guedenet: You working from home?
11/9/18, 4:25 AM - Charles G: Yep.
11/9/18, 4:53 AM - Hannah Guedenet: I left the country falling the shooting of 12 people at a synagogue. And I come back to a shooting of young people at a club. This is out of control
11/9/18, 5:12 AM - Charles G: Yeah, on both ends of the country.
11/9/18, 5:12 AM - Charles G: Sometimes I think our country is seriously messed up
11/9/18, 5:15 AM - Hannah Guedenet: **following
11/9/18, 5:15 AM - Charles G: ??
11/9/18, 5:16 AM - Hannah Guedenet: It's so awful
11/9/18, 5:19 AM - Hannah Guedenet: One of the people killed in CA survived last year's las Vegas shopping. Ugh I can't read this stuff
11/9/18, 5:20 AM - Charles G: Oh my goodness! That's so sad
11/9/18, 5:20 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Shooting
11/9/18, 5:20 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Stupid autocorrect
11/9/18, 5:20 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Give the girls big hugs from me. Traffic will be awful and we are leaving late but hope to be there by 7
11/9/18, 5:30 AM - Charles G: Ok. There will be pizza and lots of love when you arrive
11/9/18, 5:30 AM - Hannah Guedenet: I can't wait. Really.

11/9/18, 5:33 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Ok moving. Lvoe you!
11/9/18, 5:59 AM - Charles G: Bye!!
11/9/18, 2:01 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Gosh I'm listening to a marketplace story about how home mortgage interest rates are at almost 5%. This could really hurt your parents. The housing market is slowing. They just need to sell those houses!
11/9/18, 2:04 PM - Charles G: um...have you landed?
11/9/18, 2:35 PM - Hannah Guedenet: It takes so freaking long to get luggage!!!
11/9/18, 2:43 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Ok have my bag but now there's a freaking long line for taxi.
11/9/18, 2:43 PM - Hannah Guedenet: It's so cold!
11/9/18, 2:51 PM - Charles G: yeah but 5% is still pretty low when you compare to rates 10,15,20 yrs ago
11/9/18, 2:51 PM - Charles G: temperatures are below normal for this time of year
11/9/18, 2:51 PM - Charles G: traffic is going to be awful...
11/9/18, 2:53 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Yeah it looks like it will take close to 2 hours...
11/9/18, 2:53 PM - Hannah Guedenet: I want to cry
11/9/18, 2:54 PM - Hannah Guedenet: I got out of line to try Uber but it's not moving
11/9/18, 2:56 PM - Hannah Guedenet: You should see the line of cars just to get into the airport...it's awful. Was like this the other day too
11/9/18, 2:58 PM - Charles G: yeah, it's truly nightmarish
11/9/18, 3:00 PM - Charles G: hey, did you say Charlotte's prescription was already called in? At the walgreens?
11/9/18, 3:00 PM - Hannah Guedenet: They were calling it in but I haven't gotten a text that it is ready
11/9/18, 3:01 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Uber is literally not moving. This was a bad idea
11/9/18, 3:01 PM - Charles G: oh, ok
11/9/18, 3:06 PM - Hannah Guedenet: I just want to come home!!!!!
11/9/18, 3:11 PM - Charles G: me too!!!!!
11/9/18, 3:13 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Not super confident in my Uber drivers driving abilities. I should have just waited in the taxi line.
11/9/18, 3:13 PM - Hannah Guedenet: And the perfume smell in the car is nauseating
11/9/18, 3:14 PM - Charles G: ugh...sorry. Any pizza requests?
11/9/18, 3:15 PM - Hannah Guedenet: <Media omitted>
11/9/18, 3:15 PM - Hannah Guedenet: No I'll eat whatever you get
11/9/18, 3:15 PM - Charles G: two medium sized pizzas sound good?
11/9/18, 3:15 PM - Charles G: or small one for girls and medium for us?
11/9/18, 3:16 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Two mediums there is a coupon usually
11/9/18, 3:17 PM - Hannah Guedenet: He's driving 35 mph. And has no idea what he's doing
11/9/18, 3:18 PM - Hannah Guedenet: And his gps isn't working
11/9/18, 3:18 PM - Hannah Guedenet: This is why I hate rideshares
11/9/18, 3:18 PM - Hannah Guedenet: It's going to take me forever...he's going 40 on the Dulles toll road with no cars...
11/9/18, 3:19 PM - Hannah Guedenet: It's so dark...
11/9/18, 3:19 PM - Hannah Guedenet: GPS says I'll be home at 6:40 🤞

11/9/18, 3:29 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Ugh this driver is the worst.
11/9/18, 3:29 PM - Hannah Guedenet: You could go once I'm home
11/9/18, 3:47 PM - Charles G: True
11/9/18, 4:31 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Looking more like 7:30 before I'm home...
11/9/18, 4:41 PM - Charles G: Aaaaah! I'm so sorry
11/9/18, 4:42 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Might be record for longest trip home from Dulles
11/9/18, 4:50 PM - Charles G: Yeah...
11/10/18, 7:17 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Hey did you let Hamadi know we're not coming to French class today?
11/10/18, 9:08 AM - Hannah Guedenet: You looking at your phone??

11/10/18, 9:12 AM - Charles G: Messaging him now
11/10/18, 11:05 AM - Charles G: Getting ready to leave. Great discussion and talks.

11/12/18, 6:48 AM - Charles G: Sorry! I was afraid of being late. Love you too!!
11/12/18, 6:50 AM - Hannah Guedenet: No need to apologize!

11/16/18, 5:40 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Ha I was going from the kitchen to take a shower and just instinctively walked up stairs. But I'm staying in the basement. Funny how habit stays even when I haven't lived in this house in years.

11/16/18, 2:51 PM - Charles G: she made her own hat out of paper and brought that with her :)
11/16/18, 2:52 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Haha I thought it was something she made at school because she forgot her show and tell!
11/16/18, 3:00 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Lisa's asking if there are any board games the girls would like.
11/16/18, 3:00 PM - Charles G: no, she didn't have anything to do and I was busy in the kitchen so she cut out pieces of paper and taped them together. Very creative!

11/16/18, 5:33 PM - Hannah Guedenet: And she's being awful to Kalai. Told her what my parents got her for Christmas
11/16/18, 5:37 PM - Charles G: Not now... Around 8:15
11/16/18, 5:38 PM - Charles G: Why did she tell her? Cause she knew it would piss her ??
11/16/18, 5:40 PM - Hannah Guedenet: To make her as miserable as she is...as if that were possible
11/16/18, 5:47 PM - Charles G: It's awful that she didn't the job. But being alone for Thanksgiving is not going to help
11/16/18, 5:49 PM - Hannah Guedenet: No it's not
11/16/18, 5:49 PM - Hannah Guedenet: <Media omitted>

11/16/18, 6:30 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Malia is starting in on me

11/16/18, 7:26 PM - Hannah Guedenet: <Media omitted>
11/16/18, 7:27 PM - Hannah Guedenet: The thing is I'm not sure how much I do care. I love her. I've tried to talk to her. I am sad for her. But nothing I do or say will make her life better
11/16/18, 7:40 PM - Charles G: she's going to get to the point where she can't say anything hurtful because she's already said her worst and she has no trust to betray
11/16/18, 7:41 PM - Hannah Guedenet: I actually don't think she can say anything to hurt me at this point
11/16/18, 7:42 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Honestly ... What is she going to say behind that I don't love her? I'm selfish. I'm a bad mom. I'm a bad sister r
11/16/18, 7:42 PM - Hannah Guedenet: I mean she's said it all
11/16/18, 7:43 PM - Hannah Guedenet: My parents are being awful to each other. And my dad was hurt that my mom didn't come to the procedure. She taught instead.
11/16/18, 7:43 PM - Hannah Guedenet: I love you and I never want to stop being supportive of you and who you are
11/16/18, 7:46 PM - Charles G: I'm glad you went but a shame your mom didn't

11/17/18, 12:53 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Also this flight is crazy. It's 3 hours and we're on a tiny plane. 2 and 2 seats and the overhead bins are too small for roller bags. And we're in the row in front of the exit row so our seats don't recline. I also have nothing to read or watch...
11/17/18, 1:07 PM - Charles G: Wow, tough flight but much shorter than you're used to and a great destination
11/17/18, 1:07 PM - Charles G: Headed back to French school. Really hoping I didn't forget anything
11/17/18, 1:16 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Drive safe!

11/30/18, 10:13 AM - Hannah Guedenet: THANK YOU
11/30/18, 10:24 AM - Charles G: Getting regular Crisco sticks. They're out of butter flavored
11/30/18, 10:24 AM - Hannah Guedenet: that's fine
12/1/18, 11:51 AM - Hannah Guedenet: This was a bad idea but the glasses are giving me a headache
12/1/18, 2:10 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Ugh. I forgot my compression socks and the Buddha book again!!!
12/1/18, 2:11 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Franklin did a good job driving but the air freshener in the car is giving me a headache.
12/1/18, 2:11 PM - Charles G: oh crap!! Sorry!
12/1/18, 2:12 PM - Charles G: by the way, did you already schedule a parent-teacher conference for Addie or shall I do that?
12/1/18, 2:13 PM - Charles G: secondly, you OK with me giving away the travel size toiletries we used to give to airbnb guests? It's for the KAA holiday warmth drive
12/1/18, 2:14 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Yes that's a a good idea
12/1/18, 2:15 PM - Hannah Guedenet: When I looked at the sign up, the only times were for the 13th when I come back. So either you can go on your own (which I'm fine with) or we can schedule for when I'm back
12/1/18, 2:19 PM - Charles G: OK. I'll look into. i can go on my own but would prefer it be on a day my parents are doing pick up or drop off
12/1/18, 2:20 PM - Hannah Guedenet: You'll just need to talk to Ms J. It's annoying they only offer options on one day of the week
12/1/18, 2:22 PM - Charles G: yeah, it really is
12/1/18, 2:23 PM - Hannah Guedenet: I also am not sure why we need a conference for our 4 year old...
12/1/18, 2:29 PM - Charles G: yeah, I was thinking that too. I guess it'll be nice to hear more about what they do during the day although the open house did a good job of doing that
12/1/18, 2:30 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Yeah and we get photos.
12/1/18, 2:30 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Re Christmas Eve. I would love to go to the service but we have limited time with your sister
12/1/18, 2:33 PM - Charles G: hmm...that's a good point. I'll respond to matthew's email. We won't go
12/1/18, 2:46 PM - Hannah Guedenet: One perk of all this flying...short lines. 15 mins to get through check in and security
12/1/18, 3:06 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Oh man someone posted a photo of some of the fair trade stuff on offer at church tonight. I love it all!!!

12/2/18, 12:52 PM - Charles G: Hey. Thanks for the message

12/2/18, 12:55 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Addie has to be tired
12/2/18, 12:55 PM - Hannah Guedenet: It's been a long weekend
12/2/18, 1:07 PM - Hannah Guedenet: I'm so hungry. They haven't fed us since 2.

12/2/18, 4:53 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Oh babe. I miss you. And the girls.
12/2/18, 4:54 PM - Hannah Guedenet: I was just thinking how I'd listened to a podcast that I want to talk about with you but I have no idea when we'll do that. How do we find more time to connect with each other?
12/2/18, 4:55 PM - Hannah Guedenet: I hope the rest of the day went well and you're enjoying having your parents there. Please give the girls big hugs from me! Internet is not great so not sending a video. But I'll try another day.

12/4/18, 3:10 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Oh and I forgot to tell you that the gates folks have to have a security team. One of the guys is this super tall burkinabè dressed in all black and carrying a large rifle. It's a little terrifying.
12/4/18, 3:11 PM - Hannah Guedenet: I miss you guys
12/4/18, 3:13 PM - Charles G: Wow. So it's a local security team?
12/4/18, 3:14 PM - Charles G: I'll be taking the 8am call from home but then have to present at a Global Programs "town hall" meeting at 10
12/4/18, 3:14 PM - Charles G: we miss you too...a lot

12/5/18, 2:48 PM - Hannah Guedenet: You might as well have taken the IPA job. Babe, I'm not going to slow down my travel so you can increase yours...
12/5/18, 2:57 PM - Charles G: The Benin trips would be Jan, march, and June so they're spread out
12/5/18, 2:58 PM - Charles G: And they'd be one week trips
12/5/18, 2:58 PM - Hannah Guedenet: We're never going to see each other...
12/5/18, 2:58 PM - Hannah Guedenet: But I understand
12/5/18, 2:59 PM - Hannah Guedenet: I know you're super excited about this project and I'm happy for you
12/5/18, 2:59 PM - Hannah Guedenet: We should try to meet in West Africa or something. :)
12/5/18, 3:03 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Ok going to sleep. Love you!
12/5/18, 3:04 PM - Charles G: haha. That would be funny. Instead of Cabo, we could rent a beach house in Cotonou

12/6/18, 10:54 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Hey what did the girls say when you told them I'm coming home early?
12/6/18, 11:49 AM - Charles G: They heard from you first when I showed them the video
12/6/18, 11:50 AM - Charles G: they were excited, of course. I don't think Addie completely understood at first. She doesn't know days and isn't good with time
12/6/18, 11:50 AM - Hannah Guedenet: And how did they react??
12/6/18, 11:50 AM - Charles G: I think she was off this morning because of the change in routine again. She'd gotten used to the routine with my parents
12/6/18, 11:51 AM - Charles G: big smiles and shrieks
12/6/18, 11:53 AM - Hannah Guedenet: ?? Don't understand this bit
12/6/18, 11:53 AM - Charles G: that's how they reacted?
12/6/18, 11:53 AM - Hannah Guedenet: How's your day going?
12/6/18, 11:53 AM - Charles G: (no question mark)
12/6/18, 11:54 AM - Charles G: so I didn't tell you this before but I'd left my blue puff jacket from Gothenburg on the plane coming back from Cleveland. Looks like they found it and it's waiting for me at Dulles airport. Could you pick it when you arrive on Sunday?
12/6/18, 11:56 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Why didn't you tell me?
12/6/18, 11:57 AM - Charles G: I was waiting to hear back from the airport
12/6/18, 12:01 PM - Hannah Guedenet: You're a poop
12/6/18, 12:02 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Where do I need to go at the airport?
12/6/18, 12:03 PM - Charles G: 😬
12/6/18, 12:03 PM - Charles G: arrivals, door 7 in baggage claims
12/6/18, 12:04 PM - Charles G: it's between baggage aisles 2 and 3
12/6/18, 12:04 PM - Hannah Guedenet: You owe me
12/6/18, 12:04 PM - Hannah Guedenet: You poop
12/6/18, 12:05 PM - Charles G: yeah, I do. Hopefully, it'll be quick and easy

12/6/18, 3:23 PM - Charles G: wow, i was expecting a smaller one
12/6/18, 3:23 PM - Charles G: glad it fits!! She's going to be so happy
12/6/18, 3:24 PM - Charles G: headed home now. I wasn't super productive today :(
12/6/18, 3:25 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Sorry babe. Will your mom be there tonight?
12/6/18, 3:25 PM - Hannah Guedenet: He said the next size down was a toy
12/6/18, 3:25 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Now we just need to sign her up for lessons!
12/6/18, 3:26 PM - Hannah Guedenet: I love you. Hate that we haven't talked in so long. Maybe on Saturday
12/6/18, 3:52 PM - Charles G: She wants lessons from me apparently. Maybe we could take them together. Have someone come to our house every two weeks for lessons?
12/6/18, 3:52 PM - Charles G: From there, we can move up to a drum set
12/6/18, 3:53 PM - Charles G: Yeah, it would be good to talk on Saturday. I miss talking

12/6/18, 11:34 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Have you discussed with your family?
12/7/18, 2:57 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Did Addie take a fancy Nancy Christmas book to school?? Where did it come from?
12/7/18, 4:29 AM - Charles G: They want to do stockings so that Eric can have full Christmas experience. Go ahead and get small things. What kind of jelly?
12/7/18, 4:30 AM - Charles G: If she did, I don't know anything about it. I'll ask
12/7/18, 4:31 AM - Hannah Guedenet: There was a photo in life cubby
12/7/18, 4:31 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Maybe she was just the book helper
12/7/18, 4:31 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Two more sleeps!
12/7/18, 4:31 AM - Hannah Guedenet: All kinds. I think I brought some back last time
12/7/18, 4:34 AM - Charles G: How you doing?
12/7/18, 4:52 AM - Hannah Guedenet: I'm ok. A bit tired. Can't remember the last time I didn't have to wake up at 6 am...

12/7/18, 4:58 AM - Hannah Guedenet: I miss you

12/7/18, 9:33 AM - Charles G: I'm tired too. I'm looking forward to Matthew's party but they tend to go late.
12/7/18, 9:33 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Ok sorry I should have thought of it later
12/7/18, 9:36 AM - Charles G: I could have thought of it too and it's not too late!
12/7/18, 9:37 AM - Charles G: I did think of getting Lea a late birthday/Christmas present. Charlotte and I are thinking of getting a "friends forever" necklace
12/7/18, 9:46 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Sounds great!

12/8/18, 10:58 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Omg the lounge in the Ouaga airport is hilarious
12/8/18, 10:58 AM - Hannah Guedenet: <Media omitted>
12/8/18, 10:58 AM - Hannah Guedenet: But there was no toilet paper or water in the bathroom
12/8/18, 11:14 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Sorry I mentioned the thing about picking me up when the girls could hear. I just thought they'd enjoy it since Charlotte seems to be missing me so much. Really glad I'm coming home early
12/8/18, 11:25 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Also just saw on IG that Seth and Anna are having a baby girl in June. I'm really happy for him.
12/8/18, 11:47 AM - Charles G: Oh wow. That's exciting. He can be a stay at home dad
12/8/18, 11:47 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Yeah maybe
12/8/18, 12:22 PM - Hannah Guedenet: I'm the plane.
12/8/18, 12:26 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Or more accurately I'm on the plane. I haven't traveled so much that I have become the plane.
12/8/18, 12:26 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Also did you get a good white elephant gift last night???
12/8/18, 12:57 PM - Charles G: Hahaha
12/8/18, 12:58 PM - Charles G: I got a bottle of wine and funky cork light
12/8/18, 12:58 PM - Charles G: Started with rye whiskey but it got snatched
12/8/18, 12:58 PM - Charles G: Matthew gave us some beer
12/8/18, 2:31 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Cork light?
12/8/18, 2:31 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Oh man. I prefer his wine gift
12/8/18, 2:31 PM - Hannah Guedenet: We're in Ghana. I'm seated next to a toddler
12/8/18, 2:32 PM - Hannah Guedenet: And an impatient mother
12/8/18, 2:32 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Who just took off and left her child with a random guy on the plane
12/8/18, 2:44 PM - Hannah Guedenet: I actually think the mom is drugged. She's not engaging with the little girl at all and the girl is super sweet and smiley
12/8/18, 2:50 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Oops. Not drugged. Pregnant.
12/8/18, 7:21 PM - Charles G: Just saw this. You confused drugged for pregnant? Oh dear.
12/8/18, 7:33 PM - Charles G: Today was a good day. They both seemed to enjoy their French classes. Addie once again did her homework immediately after getting home. Meanwhile, Charlotte got her Jaime lire and immediately read a whole story out loud with a little help from me. Then we had hot cocoa and played sleeping Queens in front of the fire.
12/8/18, 10:12 PM - Hannah Guedenet: That sounds pretty perfect.
12/9/18, 3:35 AM - Hannah Guedenet: This lounge thing isn't so bad...
12/9/18, 3:35 AM - Hannah Guedenet: <Media omitted>
12/9/18, 3:36 AM - Hannah Guedenet: I also took a shower. And slept for about 3.5 hours. I had another panic attack on the airplane. I woke up and felt claustrophobic and like I was going to throw up. I have to stop sitting in window seats
12/9/18, 3:36 AM - Hannah Guedenet: A really nice flight attendant gave me some cool cloths to heko
12/9/18, 3:36 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Help
12/9/18, 4:59 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Annnndddd...I came very close to missing my flight. I was working in the lounge and my computer was still on Ouaga time which is an hour behind. Thankfully I looked at my phone!!
12/9/18, 5:25 AM - Hannah Guedenet: On the plane in Paris. Are y'all coming to get me or will I just see you at the house? Either way is fine. And I'll get your jacket.
12/9/18, 5:36 AM - Charles G: Yeah, we'll come get you.
12/9/18, 5:36 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Please don't if it's snowing
12/9/18, 5:36 AM - Charles G: So glad you didn't miss the flight
12/9/18, 5:36 AM - Charles G: Ok
12/9/18, 5:36 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Yeah me too
12/9/18, 5:37 AM - Charles G: 3.5 hours of sleep? Wow. That's not bad at all
12/9/18, 5:38 AM - Hannah Guedenet: You sleep ok?
12/9/18, 5:39 AM - Charles G: Yeah, slept fine. I will probably go to bed a little early tonight. I've been staying up till 11 or later
12/9/18, 5:41 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Well you can join me...I'll definitely be in bed early
12/9/18, 5:41 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Could join me for other things too...
12/9/18, 5:41 AM - Hannah Guedenet: What are you and Addie going to do??
12/9/18, 5:41 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Oops that was a very odd transition...sorry
12/9/18, 5:48 AM - Charles G: Yes, indeed
12/9/18, 5:49 AM - Charles G: Yes to the first
12/9/18, 5:49 AM - Charles G: Addie and I are going to run errands and then maybe paint a mug in silver spring
12/9/18, 5:50 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Oh cool! Maybe a bowl?? We have so many cups...
12/9/18, 5:50 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Or a piggy bank for her?? Does she have
12/9/18, 5:50 AM - Hannah Guedenet: One?
12/9/18, 5:50 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Ok taking off soon
12/9/18, 6:02 AM - Charles G: <Media omitted>

12/9/18, 2:36 PM - Hannah Guedenet: What a nut!
12/9/18, 2:36 PM - Hannah Guedenet: I've landed!!

12/9/18, 2:53 PM - Charles G: Just got here
12/9/18, 2:54 PM - Charles G: I don't want miss you coming out. You at baggage claims yet?
12/9/18, 2:54 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Nope. On the bus
12/9/18, 2:54 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Time travel back to the 1960s
12/9/18, 2:57 PM - Hannah Guedenet: I should have had you bring me a coat
12/9/18, 3:01 PM - Charles G: Where did I tell you to go to get my jacket?
12/9/18, 3:03 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Door 7 go back through the WhatsApp messages
12/9/18, 3:04 PM - Hannah Guedenet: You can search in WhatsApp too
12/9/18, 3:04 PM - Hannah Guedenet: At baggage claim
12/9/18, 3:07 PM - Charles G: Found it
12/9/18, 3:08 PM - Charles G: But there are other people...
12/9/18, 3:08 PM - Charles G: And it's on other side of airport
12/9/18, 3:11 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Just waiting for one more bag...
12/9/18, 3:12 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Got both bags
12/9/18, 3:12 PM - Hannah Guedenet: I'll walk toward you
12/9/18, 3:12 PM - Charles G: Got jacket!!
12/9/18, 3:13 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Walking slowly out of baggage claim...
12/10/18, 6:52 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Omg I think this morning just made me hornier...
12/10/18, 6:52 AM - Hannah Guedenet: That was fun
12/10/18, 7:18 AM - Charles G: haha. It's put me in a very good mood. A great way to start the day
12/10/18, 7:19 AM - Charles G: hope things weren't too rushed with the girls this morning. Sorry for my part in that
12/10/18, 7:57 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Omg that was awful
12/10/18, 7:57 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Addie screamed.
12/10/18, 7:57 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Charlotte did a great job
12/10/18, 8:38 AM - Charles G: did she scream for the xray thing? Or for the brushing too?
12/10/18, 8:38 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Both. She refused to have the X-ray and wouldn't sit in the chair for a proper cleaning. They just did a tooth brushing on my lap
12/10/18, 8:39 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Even the offer of a lollipop didn't help.
12/10/18, 8:39 AM - Hannah Guedenet: She was so stubborn
12/10/18, 8:39 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Then her class was at the library but Shannon didn't mention that when I emailed to say Addie would be late
12/10/18, 8:40 AM - Hannah Guedenet: So went to her class then had to go back and take her to the library. But the library was closed to the public so had to figure out how to have someone let us in
12/10/18, 8:40 AM - Charles G: oh man. She should be used to electric toothbrushes by now. I'm proud of Charlotte. She was really anxious about the xray
12/10/18, 8:40 AM - Hannah Guedenet: All good vibes I was feeling this morning have dissipated.
12/10/18, 8:41 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Char did awesome. I had a hard time knowing how much to praise her since Addie was being so awful. I will talk to her tonight one and one to let her know how proud of her I am.
12/10/18, 8:41 AM - Charles G: yikes... Sorry babe :(
12/10/18, 8:41 AM - Charles G: hoping the rest of your day goes well
12/10/18, 8:45 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Thanks. Hope your morning has gone well
12/10/18, 8:51 AM - Hannah Guedenet: I feel like we need to figure out what motivates Addie. I even offered her tablet time.
12/10/18, 8:55 AM - Charles G: she loves her tablet
12/10/18, 8:56 AM - Charles G: you should read the "spirited children" book. I don't think it's only about using carrots to motivate her. It's also about preparing her more in advance, acknowledging her anxiety, and maybe other stuff. I'm not very far into it
12/10/18, 8:57 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Yeah I should read it
12/10/18, 8:57 AM - Hannah Guedenet: I feel like a shitty parent this AM
12/10/18, 8:57 AM - Charles G: I'm so sorry you had to go through that
12/10/18, 8:58 AM - Charles G: it would have been me getting yelled at if you hadn't gone
12/10/18, 8:58 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Not fun for either of us
12/10/18, 3:56 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Where are you?
12/11/18, 11:30 AM - Charles G: Hey, I'm getting messages from prime now. Are you getting them too?
12/11/18, 12:25 PM - Hannah Guedenet: No...
12/11/18, 12:25 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Did you change the phone number on it??
12/11/18, 12:26 PM - Hannah Guedenet: I placed an order
12/11/18, 1:31 PM - Charles G: I probably did when I ordered Prime for myself awhile back
12/11/18, 1:31 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Ok well looks like all we didn't get was the bread
12/11/18, 1:32 PM - Charles G: ok, phew
12/11/18, 3:11 PM - Hannah Guedenet: I sent you a meeting invite for this evening. I hope you will be able to attend.
12/11/18, 3:54 PM - Hannah Guedenet: We're headed home
12/12/18, 7:10 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Hey is able coming today?
12/12/18, 7:30 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Hey I was thinking we could make a family calendar for the girls for their room. What do you think?
12/12/18, 10:33 AM - Charles G: I told Able to come between 3 and 4
12/12/18, 10:33 AM - Charles G: Yeah, family calendar would be fun. They'd love that
12/12/18, 2:18 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Another idea...an English magazine or something else they would get monthly in the mail. They love stuff like that
12/12/18, 3:46 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Where are you?
12/12/18, 3:54 PM - Charles G: National geographic for kids?

12/12/18, 6:01 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Getting Addie in bed early. Stay as long as yall want
12/12/18, 6:21 PM - Charles G: Leaving now
12/13/18, 8:12 AM - Hannah Guedenet: How'd the presentation go?
12/13/18, 11:47 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Hey I'm coming home. My cramps are so bad.

12/13/18, 12:12 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Doesn't seem you're reading these messages any way...

12/20/18, 4:15 PM - Hannah Guedenet: I don't know what to do about the antibiotic. I wonder if it's upsetting her stomach. It makes me sick
12/20/18, 4:15 PM - Charles G: Not sure what you could do that I'm not doing. Plus, Charlotte would be sad to miss drumming

12/20/18, 4:41 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Nice work
12/20/18, 4:41 PM - Hannah Guedenet: I'm ikpressed
12/20/18, 5:02 PM - Hannah Guedenet: I think we have a percussionist
12/20/18, 5:03 PM - Hannah Guedenet: <Media omitted>
12/20/18, 5:04 PM - Charles G: So serious! Makes me smile
12/20/18, 5:27 PM - Hannah Guedenet: We're headed home
12/21/18, 8:50 AM - Charles G: Hey, want to play cards when Addie naps?
12/21/18, 8:50 AM - Charles G: 😉
12/21/18, 8:51 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Ummm we have a lot to do. We might be able to squeeze it in. Shouldn't you be focusing on our daughter???
12/21/18, 9:00 AM - Charles G: I was bored...my mind goes to other things
12/21/18, 9:11 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Sorry on a call
12/25/18, 12:26 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Where are you?
12/25/18, 6:38 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Here's what I think you need to say to your dad
12/25/18, 6:38 PM - Hannah Guedenet: We appreciate you wanting to keep the girls but not sure it will work this time
12/25/18, 6:38 PM - Hannah Guedenet: You have to say something
12/25/18, 6:39 PM - Charles G: I'm, ok. It's weird because he never said anything to me about keeping the girls
12/25/18, 6:39 PM - Charles G: But I will say something
12/25/18, 6:46 PM - Hannah Guedenet: I just feel like communication in both of our families royally sucks and I don't want that to be us. Your sister just gave me total attitude because I brought in some tea that was made and sitting in the kitchen. It was for Eric but she was just so rude and said well I don't know where you should put it ! I'm sorry babe. But I'm done
12/25/18, 7:21 PM - Hannah Guedenet: https://www.halfmarathons.net/maryland-ocean-city-island-2-island-half-marathon-5k/

12/25/18, 7:22 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Your sister was being really awful to your mom.
12/25/18, 7:24 PM - Charles G: I'm sorry. This christmas has been really stressful
12/25/18, 7:24 PM - Charles G: for me at least
12/25/18, 7:25 PM - Charles G: I'm sure it hasn't been great for you either
12/25/18, 7:26 PM - Hannah Guedenet: I guess we knew it would be stressful with the moving stuff. But it's more than I expected
12/25/18, 7:26 PM - Hannah Guedenet: And no it hasn't been great. I'm ready to go home but not super excited about the prospect of a week just the 4 of us...
12/25/18, 7:26 PM - Hannah Guedenet: So just not feeling great all around
12/25/18, 7:27 PM - Hannah Guedenet: And I really wanted a whiskey and am super pissed you didn't get me one. But I know I'm just being childish
12/25/18, 7:27 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Sometimes I just don't understand how communication between people can go so awry...
12/25/18, 7:28 PM - Hannah Guedenet: This whole holiday seems like a what not to do scenario for good communication.
12/25/18, 7:29 PM - Charles G: I wish you had just let me get you a whiskey
12/25/18, 7:30 PM - Charles G: I honestly thought you didn't want one because you already had tea
12/25/18, 7:30 PM - Hannah Guedenet: We had talked about me wanting one
12/25/18, 7:30 PM - Hannah Guedenet: I'd said how much I wanted one
12/25/18, 7:30 PM - Charles G: I would have been more than happy to get you one
12/25/18, 7:31 PM - Hannah Guedenet: I didn't want to have to ask
12/25/18, 7:31 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Are you getting the nytimes?
12/25/18, 7:31 PM - Charles G: yes, I can
12/25/18, 7:32 PM - Charles G: except I'm not sure where my wallet is
12/25/18, 7:32 PM - Hannah Guedenet: I can do it if you want. Just didn't want us both doing it?
12/25/18, 7:33 PM - Charles G: yes, let's not both get a subscription! :)

12/25/18, 7:38 PM - Hannah Guedenet: That would be fun
12/25/18, 7:39 PM - Hannah Guedenet: I'm really tired. Think I might just go to sleep.
12/25/18, 7:39 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Plus I'm laying down in a bed with two sleeping children...
12/25/18, 7:39 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Share the nytimes login info once you have it
12/25/18, 7:44 PM - Charles G: did you get the subscription?
12/25/18, 7:44 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Omg. No. You said you were.

1/2/19, 7:49 AM - Charles G: I heard him hollar "au revoir. Bonne journée" to someone in his house
1/2/19, 7:50 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Doesn't surprise me. He's a Renaissance man
1/2/19, 7:50 AM - Hannah Guedenet: I think his house cleaner speaks French
1/2/19, 7:50 AM - Hannah Guedenet: I've seen/heard a French woman getting dropped off there
1/2/19, 7:56 AM - Charles G: Interesting
1/2/19, 7:56 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Where did you end up parking?
1/2/19, 7:57 AM - Charles G: Next to school. I don't like parking near Blair anymore
1/2/19, 7:57 AM - Charles G: How's your morning going?
1/2/19, 7:58 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Well I'm really only an hour into it. Had a call with Burkina. The security situation is worrisome
1/2/19, 7:58 AM - Hannah Guedenet: We have a couple of boxes in the office we need to unpack but otherwise I really like how much less cluttered it feels
1/2/19, 7:59 AM - Hannah Guedenet: I need to hang up the dry erase marker board and get a couple markers
1/2/19, 11:39 AM - Hannah Guedenet: The dilating drops are making her head hurt
1/2/19, 11:42 AM - Charles G: Poor thing
1/2/19, 11:46 AM - Hannah Guedenet: And she could see all the letters in the eye exam. No clue why she didn't pass it in the doc's office
1/2/19, 12:09 PM - Hannah Guedenet: How old were you when you got glasses
1/2/19, 12:43 PM - Charles G: I was in middle school but don't remember what age exactly.
1/2/19, 12:43 PM - Charles G: well, I'm glad she doesn't need glasses just yet.
1/2/19, 12:43 PM - Charles G: but sorry you had to make the trip for nothing
1/2/19, 12:47 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Well they did see something so good to check it out
1/2/19, 1:05 PM - Charles G: yeah, i saw your message about that.
1/2/19, 1:52 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Hey what time were you planning to leave? Just wondering if you could get Addie
1/2/19, 4:23 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Where are you?
1/3/19, 5:50 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Car is parked in the very last row near the parking lot entrance. Walk along the rail line toward the parking lot entrance and you should find it
1/3/19, 5:50 AM - Hannah Guedenet: You have to pay with your smartrip card when you exit.
1/3/19, 8:41 AM - Hannah Guedenet: How'd it go at the doc???
1/3/19, 8:46 AM - Charles G: Lots of screaming and her arms hurt now. Poor thing
1/3/19, 8:53 AM - Charles G: I felt so guilty . She kept talking about how she was going to see Ms. Buckley about her ears. Didn't even see Ms. Buckley
1/3/19, 9:17 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Oh no
1/3/19, 9:17 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Are her ears clear?
1/3/19, 9:24 AM - Charles G: They didn't look because the appointment was for her vaccinations.
1/3/19, 9:25 AM - Charles G: We would have had to schedule a meeting with Ms. Buckley
1/3/19, 9:33 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Oh no!! Ms Buckley told me they would do it at the same time!!!!
1/3/19, 9:33 AM - Hannah Guedenet: They were supposed to check!!
1/3/19, 9:33 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Dammit
1/3/19, 9:34 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Shit she's never going to want to go back!
1/3/19, 9:34 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Also did you get her a treat after it?
1/3/19, 9:34 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Sorry I should have talked to you more. You should have pushed to have them look in her ears
1/3/19, 9:49 AM - Charles G: Yeah, if I'd known Ms. Buckley had said that I would have pushed. I asked if they would look and the nurse said it hadn't been scheduled
1/3/19, 9:49 AM - Charles G: she didn't want a treat. She just wanted to go to school, she said
1/3/19, 9:49 AM - Charles G: I promised her a japanese cookie tonight
1/3/19, 9:52 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Poor thing
1/3/19, 3:23 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Hey don't forget the car is at fort Totten
1/3/19, 3:24 PM - Hannah Guedenet: <Media omitted>
1/3/19, 3:48 PM - Charles G: <Media omitted>
1/3/19, 7:12 PM - Hannah Guedenet: What ya doing?
1/3/19, 7:29 PM - Hannah Guedenet: I love you
1/3/19, 7:49 PM - Charles G: hey
1/3/19, 7:49 PM - Charles G: sorry, just noticed this
1/3/19, 7:49 PM - Charles G: I was looking up property assessments...
1/3/19, 7:49 PM - Charles G: did you know Jake and shelani's house is technically bigger than ours??
1/3/19, 7:50 PM - Hannah Guedenet: You're becoming obsessed
1/3/19, 7:50 PM - Hannah Guedenet: I'm not super shocked
1/3/19, 7:50 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Their back end is more built out and they have that weird front space
1/3/19, 7:50 PM - Charles G: bigger than ours and with finished basement like us but only assessed at 447k
1/3/19, 7:50 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Is the basement finished?m
1/3/19, 7:51 PM - Charles G: yeah but the people I will present to won't know that
1/3/19, 7:51 PM - Charles G: yeah, their basement is finished
1/3/19, 7:51 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Also their space is much less livable but agreed that is nuts
1/3/19, 7:51 PM - Charles G: megan's property is also bigger than ours and only assessed at $453k
1/3/19, 7:51 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Ok something is off
1/3/19, 7:52 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Thanks for looking into all of this. Those are huge differences to ours at $525k!
1/4/19, 11:47 AM - Hannah Guedenet: hey babe - you still playing around with your wood???
1/4/19, 11:47 AM - Hannah Guedenet: (sorry - that was too good to pass up...almost sent it to the neighbors)
1/4/19, 11:49 AM - Hannah Guedenet: just fyi - merlene's assessment for 2018 is 607,400
1/4/19, 11:49 AM - Hannah Guedenet: her house is huge though
1/4/19, 11:50 AM - Hannah Guedenet: 2500 sq ft
1/4/19, 2:35 PM - Charles G: yeah, I know. I saw her assessment yesterday. Her house is 1.75 times bigger than ours so not really comparable
1/4/19, 2:36 PM - Charles G: There are a few other houses of comparable size in sq ft and number of bathrooms that assessed for a lot less (like the one on Hammond). Granted, I think ours is nicer but still worth including in our appeal
1/4/19, 2:38 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Also were you looking at people's 2018 assessments or the new one?
1/4/19, 3:56 PM - Hannah Guedenet: So she said she can't watch TV tonight. But she doesn't want to. Then she said she doesn't get a turn - and I clarified no you don't get to watch. She seemed sad.
1/4/19, 3:57 PM - Charles G: hmm...
1/4/19, 7:19 PM - Charles G: You coming back downstairs?
1/4/19, 7:20 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Not sure I can get up. Did you get the fire started again?
1/5/19, 8:58 AM - Hannah Guedenet: So your mom wasn't joking. We shouldn't drive this car when it's wet. I just spun out trying to turn in to Carroll from Wildwood
1/5/19, 9:07 AM - Hannah Guedenet: When are your glasses supposed to be ready?
1/5/19, 9:19 AM - Charles G: Wow, that's scary
1/5/19, 9:19 AM - Charles G: They're super to call me when they're ready. They said 2 weeks
1/5/19, 9:19 AM - Charles G: Super= suppose
1/5/19, 9:24 AM - Hannah Guedenet: K
1/5/19, 9:26 AM - Hannah Guedenet: My Rx didn't change
1/5/19, 9:37 AM - Charles G: Good!
1/5/19, 9:39 AM - Hannah Guedenet: But they never know what to do with my insurance...
1/5/19, 9:39 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Maybe I should go back to myeyedoctor. I just like the optometrist here. He's quirky
1/5/19, 1:17 PM - Hannah Guedenet: 30 mins in line at post office...
1/5/19, 2:23 PM - Charles G: I have the girls. Sorry about the key. I think my tarte is a disaster. The dough wouldn't stick together.

1/12/19, 4:29 PM - Charles G: Travel
1/12/19, 4:30 PM - Charles G: Yes, i agree! There are neighborhood babysitters. We have no excuse
1/12/19, 4:31 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Maybe we could go out MLK Jr night
1/12/19, 4:31 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Bad thing is we have work next day.
1/12/19, 4:36 PM - Charles G: what about Saturday?
1/12/19, 4:38 PM - Hannah Guedenet: You get home late Friday

1/12/19, 4:38 PM - Charles G: hey, you know that phishing email I was telling you about yesterday? Well, turns out it was a test from IREX' security team.I guess I passed.

1/12/19, 4:39 PM - Hannah Guedenet: <Media omitted>

1/12/19, 4:41 PM - Hannah Guedenet: 🦄🦄🦓🦌🐮🥁
1/12/19, 4:41 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Addie
1/12/19, 4:41 PM - Charles G: 🐝🐝🙉🙉🐝🐝🦆🍒🦆🍒🛩🛩🛩  AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
1/12/19, 4:42 PM - Hannah Guedenet: I was thinking that was a very elaborate phishing
1/12/19, 4:42 PM - Charles G: can you show that to her?
1/12/19, 4:42 PM - Hannah Guedenet: You know her favorite animals she says
1/12/19, 4:42 PM - Hannah Guedenet: All the favorite things she likes
1/12/19, 4:42 PM - Charles G: yeah, me too. It was kind of freaky. It makes me feel like I was pranked though
1/12/19, 4:43 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Yeah I can see that
1/12/19, 4:43 PM - Charles G: I thought she would like the "A"s
1/12/19, 4:43 PM - Hannah Guedenet: She says that's too much As
1/12/19, 4:43 PM - Charles G: ha!
1/12/19, 4:43 PM - Hannah Guedenet: She's a but
1/12/19, 4:43 PM - Charles G: did she pick up on the patterns?
1/12/19, 4:43 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Nut
1/12/19, 4:44 PM - Hannah Guedenet: That's not a pattern. papa does not know how to make patterns. It should be 🐝 🐒 🐝 🐒
1/12/19, 4:47 PM - Charles G: I see her point. I was thinking it was multiple patterns. I should have separated them
1/12/19, 5:11 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Franklin cracks me up
1/12/19, 5:11 PM - Hannah Guedenet: And it's probably good you left when you did. The roads are getting covered
1/12/19, 5:12 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Do you have email addresses for those two neighborhood girls?
1/12/19, 5:13 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Also told Addie I would make her Mac and cheese. She asked for carrots and broccoli to go with it. 🤷
1/12/19, 5:13 PM - Hannah Guedenet: I can't figure this girl out
1/12/19, 5:23 PM - Charles G: ha, I think carrots and broccoli are her favorite vegetables. It's funny that she would actually ask for them
1/12/19, 5:24 PM - Charles G: I don't have email addresses for the neighborhood girls. Was the older girl's name "Amelia"?
If so, her number is 240 805 4795.
1/12/19, 5:36 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Yeah it's Amelia. I'll text her about next Saturday
1/12/19, 5:37 PM - Hannah Guedenet: <Media omitted>
1/12/19, 5:54 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Think we're doing something right. Char just came home from Chloe's party and asked for veggies because she didn't have any!!! 😊
1/12/19, 5:55 PM - Hannah Guedenet: I really hope you get to enjoy some you time and rejuvenate some
1/12/19, 5:56 PM - Hannah Guedenet: And I've decided I like Daniel tiger. The parents are never overly involved in the kids activities. Like the kids play and chekc in occasionally
1/12/19, 6:00 PM - Hannah Guedenet: And apparently Chloe's dad made Charlotte finsih her pizza because they didn't want to waste food. She said her stomach hurt but he made her eat it... Hmmm...
1/12/19, 6:13 PM - Charles G: Awesome that she asked for veggies. Very weird that Chloe's dad was so forceful about finishing pizza but didn't seem to care that there weren't any veggies.
1/12/19, 6:13 PM - Charles G: I hope she had fun at least
1/12/19, 6:13 PM - Charles G: did she bring cake back for Addie?
1/12/19, 6:14 PM - Hannah Guedenet: <Media omitted>
1/12/19, 6:14 PM - Hannah Guedenet: And she said it wasn't the most fun
1/12/19, 6:14 PM - Charles G: I think it's funny that you like Daniel tiger now. Did you watch it after drinking your cocktail?
1/12/19, 6:14 PM - Charles G: yay for cake! bummer it wasn't the "most fun."
1/12/19, 6:23 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Your plane still leaving on time
1/12/19, 6:23 PM - Hannah Guedenet: ?
1/12/19, 6:57 PM - Charles G: Yep. Still on time. There are only two flights going out tonight, apparently
1/12/19, 6:57 PM - Charles G: It's the post holiday slowness
1/12/19, 7:05 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Nice
1/12/19, 7:06 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Thanks for the card. I actually looked earlier under my pillow and was sad that nothing was there. Then found it when we went to read books!
1/12/19, 7:06 PM - Hannah Guedenet: You're the best!
1/12/19, 7:15 PM - Charles G: haha! I'm glad I didn't disappoint. I love you, babe
1/12/19, 7:22 PM - Hannah Guedenet: We have such good kids
1/12/19, 7:23 PM - Hannah Guedenet: And I have to think we're doing an ok job. Found this in Char's folder...

1/12/19, 7:24 PM - Hannah Guedenet: My favorite is the last one about visiting people in our family
1/12/19, 7:30 PM - Charles G: That makes me smile. We should keep it.
1/12/19, 7:30 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Yep
1/12/19, 7:31 PM - Charles G: I love they she knows our ages. I can never remember how old my parents are. My favorite is the one about drumming. I wish we hadn't missed last Wednesday's drum circle
1/12/19, 7:32 PM - Hannah Guedenet: I love that we have special things that are meaningful to her. She is also a sweetheart
1/12/19, 7:33 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Ugh this fire
1/12/19, 7:33 PM - Hannah Guedenet: It's a love hate relationship
1/12/19, 7:33 PM - Charles G: Yes she is.
1/12/19, 7:34 PM - Charles G: I will make an amazing fire when I get back
1/12/19, 7:35 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Some of the wood just won't burn
1/12/19, 7:36 PM - Hannah Guedenet: I'm really wishing I had cookies
1/12/19, 7:48 PM - Charles G: I offered yesterday. That was your chance. There's still a little peanut butter and chocolate ice cream left
1/12/19, 7:49 PM - Charles G: On the plane now. Screens are tiny
1/12/19, 7:52 PM - Hannah Guedenet: I got margarine for cc cookies. I expect them when you return
1/12/19, 7:52 PM - Hannah Guedenet: You should try to sleep
1/12/19, 7:52 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Love you!
1/12/19, 7:53 PM - Hannah Guedenet: And I had already found the ice cream
1/12/19, 7:54 PM - Charles G: Ok, no problem on the cookies. Taking off soon. Love you!
1/12/19, 8:15 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Love you too!!!
1/13/19, 5:20 AM - Charles G: I'm in Frankfurt. The flight was pretty bumpy but at least the seat next to me was empty.
1/13/19, 5:22 AM - Charles G: I'm so jealous you get to enjoy the snow
1/13/19, 5:51 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Omg it's beautiful outside!
1/13/19, 5:51 AM - Hannah Guedenet: <Media omitted>
1/13/19, 5:52 AM - Hannah Guedenet: CRCC is closed
1/13/19, 5:54 AM - Charles G: wow! looks lovely. Snow angels and snow people!!
1/13/19, 5:57 AM - Hannah Guedenet: I wish you were here. I don't love doing all the outdoor stuff. Would rather sit by the fire with coffee and watch it. I'm also worried about tomorrow and if KA and KAA will be closed...
1/13/19, 6:15 AM - Hannah Guedenet: I forgot about the yogurt and left it in for way too long...not sure what the result will be...
1/13/19, 6:26 AM - Charles G: Charlotte can play outside on her own and A has been more like you in the past.
1/13/19, 6:27 AM - Charles G: You could make chocolate chip cookies with her :)
1/13/19, 6:34 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Addie is such a pill
1/13/19, 6:37 AM - Charles G: Yeah, she has strong opinions about pants and doesn't get that she can just roll in the snow with the snow pants. Sorry babe.
1/13/19, 8:03 AM - Hannah Guedenet: <Media omitted>
1/13/19, 8:03 AM - Hannah Guedenet: You missed eggs and blueberry muffins
1/13/19, 9:34 AM - Charles G: I've landed. Can't wait to get to my hotel. Sounds like you all are having fun. As for the girls sledding, not fair!! (As c would say)

1/13/19, 1:11 PM - Charles G: It's 9:10pm here but I haven't slept since Friday night
1/13/19, 1:37 PM - Charles G: Let's try again tomorrow. This doesn't seem to be working
1/13/19, 1:38 PM - Charles G: I'll try sending a video
1/13/19, 1:41 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Ok sorry babe
1/13/19, 1:42 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Sleep well. Get some rest. When do your meetings start?
1/13/19, 6:50 PM - Hannah Guedenet: <Media omitted>
1/14/19, 2:11 AM - Charles G: Thanks for  the video. Hang in there. IREXs office is closed today
1/14/19, 2:12 AM - Charles G: <Media omitted>
1/14/19, 2:12 AM - Charles G: <Media omitted>
1/14/19, 6:46 AM - Charles G: <Media omitted>
1/14/19, 7:07 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Yes!!!!
1/14/19, 7:07 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Love that blue one and the red one below it
1/14/19, 7:07 AM - Hannah Guedenet: We need one for our bedroom!!
1/14/19, 7:07 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Beautiful!
1/14/19, 7:07 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Man I wish I was there with you!
1/14/19, 7:09 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Also just watched your video. What a cute little hotel! Are you speaking French there??
1/14/19, 7:56 AM - Charles G: Yep, speaking lots of French and loving it
1/14/19, 7:57 AM - Charles G: So, I bought a rug but not for bedroom... For hallway. It's wider and longer then the one we have
1/14/19, 7:58 AM - Charles G: Also using a spattering of Arabic and impressing people
1/14/19, 7:58 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Ok cool. Look forward to seeing it
1/14/19, 7:58 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Heading out in snow. Kids will play I'll clear things off
1/14/19, 7:58 AM - Hannah Guedenet: And so glad you're having a good time
1/14/19, 8:00 AM - Charles G: Apparently you get better prices if you're French then if you're American so I'm being introduced by my guide as French
1/14/19, 8:00 AM - Charles G: Sorry you're having to clear snow on your own. I know you hate doing it
1/14/19, 8:00 AM - Hannah Guedenet: You have a guide??
1/14/19, 8:01 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Oh well that's life
1/14/19, 8:01 AM - Hannah Guedenet: More stressed about work I should be doing but want the girls to have fun
1/14/19, 8:24 AM - Charles G: A friend of the IREX driver. Helpful because Medina market is huge
1/14/19, 8:43 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Nice!
1/14/19, 8:45 AM - Charles G: I'll send photos when I have wifi
1/14/19, 8:45 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Ok
1/14/19, 8:46 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Cleaned off both cars and sidewalk. AND did my workout this morning. I need a break!
1/14/19, 9:21 AM - Charles G: Impressive. I just walked a bunch
1/14/19, 9:24 AM - Hannah Guedenet: You should do Saturday's cardio flow. It's killer
1/14/19, 9:26 AM - Charles G: My room is tiny. I don't think I can
1/14/19, 9:28 AM - Hannah Guedenet: It did look small but cute
1/14/19, 9:28 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Addie was still awake at 10 last night. She ended up sleeping with me all night and was up at 6. She's taking a nap
1/14/19, 9:30 AM - Charles G: Why?? She just couldn't sleep? I would have thought the sledding would have exhausted her
1/14/19, 9:31 AM - Hannah Guedenet: I thought so too. She took a nap but it wasn't that long
1/14/19, 10:01 AM - Hannah Guedenet: we need a new soap dispenser
1/14/19, 10:01 AM - Hannah Guedenet: and i need heavier weights
1/14/19, 10:48 AM - Hannah Guedenet: <Media omitted>
1/14/19, 11:05 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Going to take naps! Love you!!
1/14/19, 11:48 AM - Hannah Guedenet: You back at your hotel?
1/14/19, 11:49 AM - Charles G: The girls were having fun making faces! love it. thanks
1/14/19, 11:49 AM - Charles G: you looked a little tired
1/14/19, 11:50 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Thanks. I slept horribly last night. No idea why
1/14/19, 11:50 AM - Hannah Guedenet: I'm so tired of not sleeping well
1/14/19, 11:51 AM - Hannah Guedenet: And I just tried to take a nap but never really rested
1/14/19, 11:52 AM - Charles G: sorry, hun. I took all our sleeping pills...
1/14/19, 11:52 AM - Hannah Guedenet: I shouldn't take them when I'm alone with the girls any way
1/14/19, 11:53 AM - Hannah Guedenet: So you didn't work at all today?
1/14/19, 11:53 AM - Charles G: I worked a little morning but mostly prepped for tomorrow
1/14/19, 11:53 AM - Charles G: I should be working now
1/14/19, 11:55 AM - Hannah Guedenet: So why did you get there a day early?
1/14/19, 11:58 AM - Hannah Guedenet: It's evening
1/14/19, 11:59 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Also char started crying watching your video
1/14/19, 11:59 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Granted she's tired and was overly emotional today
1/14/19, 12:00 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Oh here's a good one from Addie yesterday that I forgot to tell you. Addie was whining because she didn't have snow gloves. I asked the neighbors if we could borrow a pair. When they brought over a perfectly good pair of red gloves, she refused to where them because "they're not beautiful"
1/14/19, 12:00 PM - Hannah Guedenet: When I told her she had a pair of red gloves (the Swiss ones) she told me the x makes them beautiful
1/14/19, 12:01 PM - Hannah Guedenet: I can't even
1/14/19, 12:01 PM - Charles G: she used the word "beautiful"??
1/14/19, 12:02 PM - Charles G: she really has her own personality and own opinions about everything
1/14/19, 12:03 PM - Charles G: char started crying? She is so sensitive. She gets weepy when you leave too.
1/14/19, 12:03 PM - Charles G: sensitive in a good way
1/14/19, 12:05 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Yes to all of the above. And she said beautiful with her little lisp not was hard not to laugh
1/14/19, 12:08 PM - Charles G: hahaha
1/14/19, 12:09 PM - Charles G: I love it when she tries to say longer words
1/14/19, 12:46 PM - Hannah Guedenet: is the food good there?
1/14/19, 12:53 PM - Charles G: I had lunch with an IREX expat and took me an American restaurant. Good food but not what i wanted
1/14/19, 12:53 PM - Charles G: then, another Tunisian IREX person brought me a european place. I had "Tunisian savory crepe" but it tasted pretty western to me
1/14/19, 12:54 PM - Charles G: the most Tunisian dish I've had is the $2.50 charma I bought last night
1/14/19, 12:54 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Haha
1/14/19, 12:54 PM - Hannah Guedenet: They don't know you
1/14/19, 12:58 PM - Charles G: clearly
1/14/19, 12:58 PM - Charles G: but the IREX woman said she wants to invite me to her mother in-laws for dinner this week
1/14/19, 1:12 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Cool
1/14/19, 1:42 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Hey I need bonsai instructions
1/14/19, 2:03 PM - Charles G: Internet is awful in hotel. Did any of my photos go through?
1/14/19, 2:04 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Also if you see a round tablecloth, get it!!!
1/14/19, 2:04 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Yep
1/14/19, 2:04 PM - Charles G: Re: bonsaï, please water them all today
1/14/19, 2:04 PM - Charles G: House plants can wait until I get back
1/14/19, 2:05 PM - Charles G: Ok!
1/14/19, 2:10 PM - Hannah Guedenet: What about the succulents?
1/14/19, 2:12 PM - Charles G: They can wait a few days
1/14/19, 2:13 PM - Charles G: Or until I get back
1/14/19, 2:18 PM - Charles G: Going to bed now. Hopefully my messages go through eventually. Love you very much!! I'll write more tomorrow
1/14/19, 2:30 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Char is at coda's. And A and I are watching Moana with Evelyn and Bennet
1/14/19, 4:46 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Guess you went to bed. And can you send me more instructions for the bonsaï please
1/14/19, 4:46 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Sleep well and good luck tomorrow!
1/14/19, 5:02 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Sleep well. We're having dinner at kin da!
1/14/19, 8:16 PM - Hannah Guedenet: <Media omitted>
1/15/19, 7:15 AM - Hannah Guedenet: And the day is off. A little later than usual. And char and I had another talk about her focusing. I have to tell her like 10 times to do something. She is just so absent minded. Addie is actually more helpful in the mornings!!
1/15/19, 7:16 AM - Hannah Guedenet: And I had gone out to the car to scrape it off and all. I told Charlotte to shut the door behind her and come out - it would lock behind her. Of course, she shut the door but left her backpack inside the house!!!!
1/15/19, 7:19 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Addie came into bed with me again last night around 2 am. Not sure this is a good habit we've started ...
1/15/19, 8:16 AM - Charles G: Hey. Workshop just ended. Lots of fun activities. Fascinating how everyone just went in and out of arabic, French, and English throughout. Made my head spin
1/15/19, 8:26 AM - Charles G: I'm glad you talked to C about focusing. I hate having to ask her three times to do something. I was thinking we should create a checklist on the blackboard of what she needs to get done every morning: brush hair, brush teeth, get snack, clean off table, etc
1/15/19, 8:27 AM - Charles G: Yeah, sorry for you. Not a good habit at all.
1/15/19, 8:36 AM - Hannah Guedenet: I actually like having her in there. She's cozy. But I wake her up when I get up.
1/15/19, 8:36 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Sounds like a great day!!!
1/15/19, 8:37 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Yeah I want her to write the list though
1/15/19, 8:37 AM - Hannah Guedenet: She needs to be empowered
1/15/19, 8:41 AM - Hannah Guedenet: shit...
1/15/19, 8:41 AM - Hannah Guedenet: https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/15/world/africa/nairobi-attack.html
1/15/19, 8:51 AM - Charles G: Good idea
1/15/19, 8:51 AM - Charles G: Oh man. Another attack in Nairobi
1/15/19, 9:56 AM - Charles G: <Media omitted>
1/15/19, 10:02 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Me too
1/15/19, 10:02 AM - Hannah Guedenet: This was right near where I went shopping while in Nairobi and bought all those souvenirs for my family and the girls
1/15/19, 10:09 AM - Charles G: <Media omitted>
1/15/19, 10:11 AM - Charles G: I'll so sorry. How terrifying. Have y heard from people you know there?
1/15/19, 10:12 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Wow
1/15/19, 10:12 AM - Hannah Guedenet: And you take crooked photos like your dad
1/15/19, 10:12 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Yeah everyone is accounted for
1/15/19, 10:16 AM - Charles G: Thank goodness. I'm glad we didn't move there
1/15/19, 1:06 PM - Hannah Guedenet: we should order a sled
1/15/19, 1:06 PM - Hannah Guedenet: one that addie can ride with us in
1/15/19, 1:06 PM - Hannah Guedenet: they are really expensive though!
1/15/19, 1:06 PM - Hannah Guedenet: also need to get addie "beautiful" snow gloves
1/16/19, 5:04 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Morning babe
1/16/19, 5:04 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Hope you're having a great day so far. Wish you were here. I didn't get up and do my workout this morning. Once again didn't sleep great. I miss you.
1/16/19, 5:23 AM - Charles G: I didn't sleep enough either and the sessions this morning were right or not entirely useful, in my opinion.
1/16/19, 5:24 AM - Charles G: Right = tough
1/16/19, 5:24 AM - Charles G: Did A sleep with you again?
1/16/19, 5:25 AM - Hannah Guedenet: That sucks.
1/16/19, 5:25 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Nope. I asked here what would happen when you came home and were sleeping in our bed...she just giggled
1/16/19, 5:25 AM - Hannah Guedenet: She did move back to her bed. I think sleeping in our bed reminded her how much more comfortable a bed is than the floor
1/16/19, 5:26 AM - Hannah Guedenet: One American was killed in the Kenya attack. 14 total
1/16/19, 5:27 AM - Charles G: Haha. I'm glad she went back on her own and didn't need too much encouraging
1/16/19, 5:28 AM - Charles G: 14... That's a lot but much fewer than mall attack
1/16/19, 5:28 AM - Charles G: It's so sad.
1/16/19, 5:30 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Are you 5 hours ahead?
1/16/19, 5:30 AM - Hannah Guedenet: She did insist I come up and put her sleeping bag away...
1/16/19, 5:37 AM - Charles G: 6 hours I think. It's 1:30 noq
1/16/19, 8:02 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Got it
1/16/19, 8:02 AM - Hannah Guedenet: <Media omitted>
1/16/19, 8:02 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Otherwise she just stands around. This have her a purpose
1/16/19, 9:25 AM - Charles G: <Media omitted>
1/16/19, 9:27 AM - Hannah Guedenet: is it tiles?
1/16/19, 9:28 AM - Hannah Guedenet: it's pretty but not very colorful...
1/16/19, 9:28 AM - Hannah Guedenet: where are you thinking to put it?
1/16/19, 9:39 AM - Charles G: In living room? We gave a tree theme there
1/16/19, 9:40 AM - Hannah Guedenet: true
1/16/19, 9:40 AM - Hannah Guedenet: we have one tree...
1/16/19, 9:40 AM - Hannah Guedenet: how big is it?
1/16/19, 9:40 AM - Charles G: I hate negotiating prices
1/16/19, 9:40 AM - Hannah Guedenet: are those bowls above it?
1/16/19, 9:41 AM - Charles G: I got a smaller one about 18 inches by 12 inches...
1/16/19, 9:41 AM - Charles G: I'm buying anything more. I'm done
1/16/19, 9:41 AM - Hannah Guedenet: ok
1/16/19, 9:41 AM - Charles G: Not buying
1/16/19, 9:41 AM - Hannah Guedenet: NOOO!!!
1/16/19, 9:41 AM - Hannah Guedenet: i love those plates
1/16/19, 9:41 AM - Hannah Guedenet: the blue ones!!!
1/16/19, 9:41 AM - Hannah Guedenet: :(
1/16/19, 9:41 AM - Hannah Guedenet: i want to go shopping!
1/16/19, 9:42 AM - Charles G: Yeah, wish you were here. So many pretty bowls and glasses
1/16/19, 9:42 AM - Charles G: I Wish it was Christmas time
1/16/19, 9:42 AM - Hannah Guedenet: did you get earrings?🤪
1/16/19, 9:42 AM - Charles G: Yes, of course. At Medina
1/16/19, 9:43 AM - Hannah Guedenet: YAY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1/16/19, 9:43 AM - Charles G: You'll like them
1/16/19, 10:00 AM - Hannah Guedenet: i cannot wait
1/16/19, 10:00 AM - Hannah Guedenet: i miss you, babe
1/16/19, 10:00 AM - Hannah Guedenet: a lot
1/16/19, 10:19 AM - Hannah Guedenet: hey - ana is talking about corporate indicators
1/16/19, 10:21 AM - Hannah Guedenet: do you have anything written up on the guidance?
1/16/19, 10:22 AM - Hannah Guedenet: she wanted to have a metric that is number of people served
1/16/19, 10:22 AM - Hannah Guedenet: i'm not a fan
1/16/19, 10:24 AM - Hannah Guedenet: also - ana expects our revenue to be 20 million in 2021
1/16/19, 10:24 AM - Hannah Guedenet: it was 6.5 in 2018...
1/16/19, 10:26 AM - Charles G: That is usually the first one used for cross organization measurement
1/16/19, 10:26 AM - Hannah Guedenet: i thought you said people were using it less...
1/16/19, 10:26 AM - Charles G: But does she want both direct and indirect people served?
1/16/19, 10:27 AM - Hannah Guedenet: she didn't say
1/16/19, 10:27 AM - Hannah Guedenet: she wants a metric that we would track
1/16/19, 10:27 AM - Hannah Guedenet: i guess i'm curious what are the ones you are using for IREX?
1/16/19, 10:30 AM - Hannah Guedenet: sorry if you're in the middle of a meeting (you were sending me pics from the market so i assumed you were done)
1/16/19, 11:04 AM - Charles G: hey, I'm back. Just had a crappy pizza for dinner.
1/16/19, 11:04 AM - Charles G: I miss vegetables
1/16/19, 11:06 AM - Charles G: The number of beneficiaries is one that's used by our communications team a lot. It gives you a big number and shows how big your reach is. I don't care much for it though.
1/16/19, 11:06 AM - Hannah Guedenet: sorry babe
1/16/19, 11:07 AM - Hannah Guedenet: i was planning to make skilet lasagna sat night - maybe i should make something else
1/16/19, 11:09 AM - Hannah Guedenet: what would be your ideal?
1/16/19, 11:10 AM - Charles G: ratatoui but I know the girls are big fans
1/16/19, 11:10 AM - Charles G: are NOT big fans
1/16/19, 11:10 AM - Charles G: brussel sprouts?
1/16/19, 11:11 AM - Hannah Guedenet: i don't love it
1/16/19, 11:11 AM - Hannah Guedenet: either
1/16/19, 11:12 AM - Hannah Guedenet: i was going to make brussel sprouts with the lasagna
1/16/19, 11:12 AM - Hannah Guedenet: or a big salad
1/16/19, 11:12 AM - Charles G: yeah, i know
1/16/19, 11:12 AM - Hannah Guedenet: i'll make some kind of veggie soup on sunday night when neighbors come over
1/16/19, 11:12 AM - Charles G: yes to brussel sprouts!
1/16/19, 11:12 AM - Charles G: cool. They're coming over? great.
1/16/19, 11:12 AM - Charles G: do you still want to go out on a date night on Saturday?
1/16/19, 11:17 AM - Hannah Guedenet: yeah we're doing the game night/sleep over on Sunday
1/16/19, 11:17 AM - Hannah Guedenet: i think the girls will be really sad if we go out
1/16/19, 11:17 AM - Hannah Guedenet: and i haven't gotten a sitter
1/16/19, 11:35 AM - Hannah Guedenet: you done any workouts or gone for a run or anything?
1/16/19, 11:38 AM - Charles G: oh yeah, forgot about game night. Fun
1/16/19, 11:38 AM - Charles G: no, I have done any workouts and I'm not sleeping great
1/16/19, 11:39 AM - Hannah Guedenet: do you have an ideal metric?
1/16/19, 11:39 AM - Charles G: and no meditation or anything. Probably explains why I was feeling so edgy today
1/16/19, 11:40 AM - Hannah Guedenet: HELP ON THE METRIC PLASE
1/16/19, 11:41 AM - Hannah Guedenet: ana is aksing me!!!!
1/16/19, 11:43 AM - Charles G: she wants to know what the ideal metric is?
1/16/19, 11:44 AM - Hannah Guedenet: YES
1/16/19, 11:44 AM - Hannah Guedenet: please
1/16/19, 11:44 AM - Charles G: like, you want me to tell you what to measure? Or just guidance on what to think about when selecting indicator?
1/16/19, 11:45 AM - Hannah Guedenet: never mind
1/16/19, 11:45 AM - Charles G: It's not a simple question
1/16/19, 11:45 AM - Hannah Guedenet: i thought you had metrics you had developed for IREX
1/16/19, 11:45 AM - Hannah Guedenet: i was asking what your top one would be
1/16/19, 11:45 AM - Hannah Guedenet: it's fine
1/16/19, 11:45 AM - Hannah Guedenet: we can talk about it whe you're home
1/16/19, 11:46 AM - Charles G: number of youth who improved their education or employment status
1/16/19, 11:46 AM - Charles G: not useful
1/16/19, 11:46 AM - Hannah Guedenet: but i see your point - something relevant to the work we're actually doing
1/16/19, 11:46 AM - Charles G: yes
1/16/19, 11:47 AM - Charles G: also, measuring "people served" is not as easy as one might think. People get all confused about direct and indirect beneficiaries and then you have to deal with double counting
1/16/19, 11:48 AM - Charles G: my advice is to start with output indicators and then slowly go from there
1/16/19, 11:48 AM - Hannah Guedenet: ok thanks - this is helpful
1/16/19, 11:48 AM - Hannah Guedenet: i can at least give her that advice
1/16/19, 11:48 AM - Hannah Guedenet: thank you
1/16/19, 11:49 AM - Hannah Guedenet: did you see the picture of char's to do list?
1/16/19, 11:52 AM - Charles G: I just sent you a couple documents. I have a ton of resources on developing organizational metrics
1/16/19, 11:52 AM - Hannah Guedenet: thanks
1/16/19, 11:53 AM - Charles G: nice to-do list :) She likes it?
1/16/19, 11:53 AM - Hannah Guedenet: she seemed to - we'll see how long it lasts
1/16/19, 11:56 AM - Hannah Guedenet: i need to get lunch and do a workout at some point...
1/16/19, 1:57 PM - Charles G: in case I do decide to spend more money tomorrow, would you prefer I get olive oil or pretty bowls/cups/plates?
1/16/19, 2:14 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Pretty plates
1/16/19, 2:14 PM - Hannah Guedenet: We have plenty of cups
1/16/19, 2:14 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Well maybe one new mjg
1/16/19, 2:14 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Mug
1/16/19, 2:14 PM - Hannah Guedenet: And maybe a bowl or two.
1/16/19, 2:14 PM - Hannah Guedenet: No we have Joel's
1/16/19, 2:15 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Bowls
1/16/19, 2:21 PM - Charles G: we're good on serving platters? appetizers platters?
1/16/19, 2:21 PM - Hannah Guedenet: You've really had time to explore.
1/16/19, 2:21 PM - Hannah Guedenet: I mean depends on the size I guess. The serving platter we have is just plain white. Kind of Boeing.
1/16/19, 2:22 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Boring
1/16/19, 2:22 PM - Charles G: I'm next to a dozen or so stores with everything you can think of. It's a tourist destination
1/16/19, 2:23 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Ahhh
1/16/19, 2:24 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Maybe get olive oil for your parents. We don't want to give them knick knacks we will just have to do something with in the future...
1/16/19, 2:24 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Maybe that is unkind
1/16/19, 2:24 PM - Hannah Guedenet: You should get some sleep
1/16/19, 2:35 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Just watched the video from Charlotte's class and I can hear her coughing in the background. It's been a few days without the allergy medicine because we ran out. I'll get some tonight
1/16/19, 2:43 PM - Hannah Guedenet: ok going to work out then get the girls
1/16/19, 2:43 PM - Hannah Guedenet: love you
1/16/19, 3:41 PM - Charles G: Going to bed finally. Had to prep for tomorrow and review a proposal. But tomorrow will be a half day so I'll be fine
1/16/19, 3:41 PM - Charles G: Love you so much. Good night
1/16/19, 6:43 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Oh man babe! You have to be exhausted!
1/16/19, 6:43 PM - Hannah Guedenet: The girls were sad you didn't say good night. But I told them you were fast asleep!
1/16/19, 6:43 PM - Hannah Guedenet: I love you
1/16/19, 8:00 PM - Hannah Guedenet: No video. Had things I wanted to tell you but then they disappear. Overall had a good night with the girls. Addie makes me laugh and frustrates me all at the same time. I watched the video Mr Hutton sent from class. I was super proud of Charlotte speaking up. She is not shy. She is maybe a little reserved but she has a lot of self confidence.
1/16/19, 8:00 PM - Hannah Guedenet: I'm so tired. Going to bed!! Love you!!
1/16/19, 8:06 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Oh I know one of the things. I made shrimp tonight and kept saying she didn't know what I was talking about when I told her we were having shrimp. At the table she asked - how do you say this in French? When I told her, she said ahhh now I know what you're talking about. She ate them this summer with your folks. But they were always crevettes and not shrimp! 🤣😂
1/17/19, 5:47 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Morning sexy. Got up and did AAA workout this morning and rocked it!!! I need heavier weights though
1/17/19, 5:47 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Got a message from Malia in the middle of the night. She cancelled her interview on Friday. I have no idea why. And she exhausts me.
1/17/19, 5:48 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Hope you got some sleep and are having a good day!!! I love you!
1/17/19, 5:52 AM - Hannah Guedenet: <Media omitted>
1/17/19, 6:35 AM - Charles G: Good morning!!
1/17/19, 6:35 AM - Charles G: I love the story about shrimp. 😊
1/17/19, 6:38 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Like I said. She cracks me up
1/17/19, 6:39 AM - Hannah Guedenet: I think half of the time her frustration is because she doesn't know what's happening
1/17/19, 7:09 AM - Charles G: Last time I got shrimp somewhere with her, she got excited and kept telling C: "we're eating crevette!"
1/17/19, 7:10 AM - Charles G: Workshop is done but everything is closed because of a general government strike. So frustrating
1/17/19, 7:10 AM - Charles G: This must be what it feels like for people visiting Washington DC right now
1/17/19, 8:37 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Sorry about the strike. That sucks. But you can shop!!
1/17/19, 8:37 AM - Hannah Guedenet: How are you getting everything home? Is there room in your suitcase?
1/17/19, 8:38 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Also ... Did you catch in the video when Addie was trying to help Char with her French?? And Addie can sing those French songs on the CD in the car!!! I think we underestimate her French abilities
1/17/19, 8:45 AM - Charles G: I have tons of room in my suitcase. I only packed for a few days
1/17/19, 8:47 AM - Charles G: I am so tired of dealing with the venders. You cant just walk into a store, browse, and ask for prices. They insist on trying to build rapport and it takes forever
1/17/19, 8:48 AM - Charles G: The video isn't loading 😒
1/17/19, 10:22 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Totally understand
1/17/19, 10:22 AM - Hannah Guedenet: No worries babe
1/17/19, 10:22 AM - Hannah Guedenet: What time is your flight tomorrow?
1/17/19, 10:24 AM - Charles G: my flight is at 12:45
1/17/19, 10:26 AM - Charles G: the hustling is so bad. I went to get mint tea with almonds (yum) and the waiter insisted I give him a tip. It went on for a while with me saying no and he trying to convince me.
1/17/19, 10:27 AM - Charles G: Tonight I'm meeting a couple IREX colleagues for dinner at 9pm. Should be fun
1/17/19, 10:27 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Mint tea with almonds??? Sounds delicious!!
1/17/19, 10:27 AM - Hannah Guedenet: And sounds like a fun dinner too
1/17/19, 10:28 AM - Charles G: yeah, they add raw almonds into the tea.
1/17/19, 10:33 AM - Charles G: just saw the video! Love it!! 😊 but I can't understand what book it is your reading?
1/17/19, 10:35 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Can you buy some tea from a store or something? Where you don't have to haggle?
1/17/19, 10:35 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Did I tell you I got up and worked out today???
1/17/19, 10:36 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Also did you find presents for the girls?
1/17/19, 10:38 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Also I just emailed you a link to the video. See if that works.
1/17/19, 11:00 AM - Charles G: i sent this earlier but I'm not sure it went through
1/17/19, 11:01 AM - Charles G: I'll do some more shopping tomorrow morning. I just can't muster energy to do it now
1/17/19, 11:01 AM - Charles G: yes, you rocked the AAA! I am really looking forward to going back to my routine
1/17/19, 11:03 AM - Charles G: I got some smaller tiles for the girls. One has a butterfly and the other a sun. I'm a little proud of my bargaining there. The guy started at 120 dinar, I got it down to just 20 dinar (less than $3) for both. I'm not sure how excited the girls will be but I didn't want to get trinkets or stuffed animals for them
1/17/19, 11:35 AM - Hannah Guedenet: You're welcome to join but I need heavier weights. In case I haven't mentioned that
1/17/19, 11:39 AM - Charles G: well, let's get some
1/17/19, 11:51 AM - Hannah Guedenet: 15, 20, & 25???
1/17/19, 12:19 PM - Charles G: Sure
1/17/19, 12:19 PM - Hannah Guedenet: k
1/17/19, 12:19 PM - Hannah Guedenet: also malia is a hot mess
1/17/19, 12:19 PM - Hannah Guedenet: and i have no idea what to do
1/17/19, 12:19 PM - Hannah Guedenet: i really can't offer for her to live with us
1/17/19, 12:20 PM - Hannah Guedenet: i just don't think i could handle it. and kalai feels the same - she just doesn't know if she can handle having her in their home
1/17/19, 12:33 PM - Charles G: So why did she cancel her interview??
1/17/19, 12:34 PM - Hannah Guedenet: <Media omitted>
1/17/19, 3:12 PM - Hannah Guedenet: <Media omitted>
1/17/19, 4:54 PM - Charles G: Hey, finally home. Had a very long and nice dinner with American and a Tunisian woman along with her husband. I can't think of a better way to finish my trip. You'll have to tell mr why you never wanted to visit here.
1/17/19, 4:55 PM - Hannah Guedenet: It's not that I never wanted to. It just wasn't on my list
1/17/19, 4:55 PM - Hannah Guedenet: I feel like shit. Have another migraine
1/17/19, 4:55 PM - Charles G: Wow, her messages are messed up on so many levels
1/17/19, 4:56 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Yes. Kalai talked to her and offered her a place to live. I just can't...
1/17/19, 4:57 PM - Charles G: I think Charlotte would say the same thing at her age. You're a good role model
1/17/19, 4:59 PM - Hannah Guedenet: No turns out she just wants to have a baby in her belly...
1/17/19, 4:59 PM - Hannah Guedenet: I need to make dinner.
1/17/19, 4:59 PM - Hannah Guedenet: I can barely stand up
1/17/19, 5:02 PM - Charles G: Oh gosh, babe.
1/17/19, 5:03 PM - Charles G: Can you just get food delivered?
1/17/19, 5:03 PM - Charles G: I wish I was there to help
1/17/19, 5:04 PM - Charles G: I really gotta go to sleep
1/17/19, 5:05 PM - Hannah Guedenet: No they are expecting breakfast for dinner
1/17/19, 5:06 PM - Charles G: <Media omitted>
1/17/19, 5:07 PM - Charles G: <Media omitted>
1/17/19, 5:10 PM - Charles G: <Media omitted>
1/17/19, 5:18 PM - Hannah Guedenet: I ran the fan inside the dishwasher for 24 hours and tried to run it. Still not working!!! 😫😫😫😫
1/17/19, 5:52 PM - Hannah Guedenet: And omg our daughters just ate sooooo many waffles and pancakes!!!
1/17/19, 5:52 PM - Hannah Guedenet: And Addie had three helpings of smoothie
1/18/19, 3:50 AM - Charles G: They love breakfast for dinner!! You make killer smoothies
1/18/19, 3:51 AM - Charles G: I'm going to board my first flight soon. I have such a headache though. Drank too much wine last night and not enough water
1/18/19, 3:55 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Safe flight babe!!
1/18/19, 3:55 AM - Hannah Guedenet: See you soon!!!😍😍😍😍
1/18/19, 3:58 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Hey can you give me he name of the dishwasher repair person? I can call and set up a time for him to come. And we might start using paper plates...
1/18/19, 4:10 AM - Charles G: I can't find his number. I've been looking but can't remember his name
1/18/19, 4:14 AM - Charles G: Sorry. I found him on Angie's list. Can you look there?
1/18/19, 5:21 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Ugh I don't have time to sift through all of them
1/18/19, 5:57 AM - Hannah Guedenet: And I hate our garage door. It took me 5 mins to get it open. Might be that I lifted heavy weights and had no grip strength left. But it's still obnoxious
1/18/19, 7:09 AM - Charles G: Just landed in Frankfurt. I'll see if I can a repair person when I connect to internet.
1/18/19, 7:10 AM - Charles G: Yeah, the garage takes time to get used to
1/18/19, 7:38 AM - Hannah Guedenet: how long is your layover?
1/18/19, 7:38 AM - Hannah Guedenet: i'm so ready for you to be home
1/18/19, 8:31 AM - Charles G: It was pretty short. I'm already on the plane. Sorry, don't have time to search Angie's list. I can do it tomorrow morning
1/18/19, 8:32 AM - Charles G: I'm ready to be home
1/18/19, 8:32 AM - Hannah Guedenet: ok
1/18/19, 8:32 AM - Hannah Guedenet: no worries
1/18/19, 8:32 AM - Hannah Guedenet: so i have cancelled on erica like three times
1/18/19, 8:33 AM - Hannah Guedenet: i'm planning to take the girls to have lunch with her tomorrow
1/18/19, 8:33 AM - Hannah Guedenet: you don't have to come
1/18/19, 8:33 AM - Hannah Guedenet: lunch and then take them to french class
1/18/19, 8:33 AM - Hannah Guedenet: i have a massage at9
1/18/19, 8:35 AM - Charles G: Ok, I'll see. I enjoy Erica but realize you guys probably want to talk about your own stuff
1/18/19, 8:35 AM - Hannah Guedenet: k
1/18/19, 8:38 AM - Charles G: Is it snowing right now?
1/18/19, 8:38 AM - Hannah Guedenet: no it snowed last night
1/18/19, 8:39 AM - Hannah Guedenet: the trees were really pretty but thankfully it didn't stick to the roads
1/18/19, 8:40 AM - Charles G: Got it. I will make a roaring fire, just you see
1/18/19, 8:40 AM - Hannah Guedenet: thanks
1/18/19, 8:55 AM - Charles G: Getting ready for takeoff. Love you!!
1/18/19, 8:55 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Woohoo!
1/18/19, 8:56 AM - Hannah Guedenet: So ready for you to be home
1/18/19, 4:41 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Ahhhhhhhh!!!!! I thought the soap dispenser was broken. You just put the batteries in wrong!!!!! 😫
1/18/19, 4:41 PM - Hannah Guedenet: You drive me crazy...
1/18/19, 4:41 PM - Hannah Guedenet: I already bought a new soap dispenser...
1/18/19, 5:59 PM - Charles G: Just landed. I feel like shit
1/18/19, 5:59 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Yay!!!!!!
1/18/19, 5:59 PM - Hannah Guedenet: I mean not that you feel like shit
1/18/19, 5:59 PM - Hannah Guedenet: My cocktail just kicked in. I'm feeling great!!! Girls are waiting for cookies and watching TV!!
1/18/19, 5:59 PM - Hannah Guedenet: You are back!!!!
1/18/19, 6:00 PM - Hannah Guedenet: <Media omitted>
1/18/19, 6:07 PM - Charles G: Oh man. I'm so jealous of your Friday night
1/18/19, 6:08 PM - Charles G: I miss you guys and our routine
1/18/19, 6:13 PM - Hannah Guedenet: We miss you too
1/18/19, 6:24 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Actually I just want my presents!!! 😁
1/18/19, 6:24 PM - Hannah Guedenet: So much food shopping!
1/18/19, 6:24 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Good
1/18/19, 6:27 PM - Hannah Guedenet: I might have another cocktail. I'm feeling quite impressed with myself. This week went really well!!!
1/18/19, 6:29 PM - Hannah Guedenet: I survived snow, broken dishwasher, migraine, crazy work. And we're all alive!!!
1/18/19, 6:29 PM - Hannah Guedenet: And there was minimal yellingN
1/18/19, 6:30 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Yes, I am awesome.
1/18/19, 6:30 PM - Hannah Guedenet: <Media omitted>
1/18/19, 6:44 PM - Charles G: You're really good with the emojis now.
1/18/19, 6:45 PM - Charles G: And so glad you nailed it this week
1/18/19, 6:45 PM - Charles G: <Media omitted>
1/18/19, 6:51 PM - Charles G: Which friend is on that jury?
1/18/19, 7:01 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Kara
1/18/19, 7:04 PM - Hannah Guedenet: You in the taxi??
1/18/19, 7:04 PM - Charles G: Yeah, no traffic at all
1/18/19, 7:11 PM - Charles G: I'm on University
1/18/19, 7:11 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Oh I just put cookies in

1/18/19, 7:11 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Some
1/18/19, 7:11 PM - Hannah Guedenet: That was fast. I just started top chef...
1/18/19, 7:11 PM - Charles G: There's still so much snow!
1/18/19, 7:11 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Yep. What about cookies??
1/18/19, 7:12 PM - Charles G: No thank you. I feel yucky
1/18/19, 7:12 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Ok
1/19/19, 8:09 AM - Charles G: What did I tell Hamadi about French class?
1/19/19, 8:09 AM - Charles G: We'll pick up Ana?
1/19/19, 8:09 AM - Charles G: I will
1/19/19, 8:32 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Yeah we can. We just can't take her
1/19/19, 8:32 AM - Hannah Guedenet: I mean it's up to you
1/19/19, 8:32 AM - Hannah Guedenet: I'm grabbing a couple things at coop then will be home
1/19/19, 10:13 AM - Charles G: Hey, Hamadi very kindly offered to bring the girls back since I just got back from a trip. Can you let the girls know?
1/19/19, 10:13 AM - Charles G: Also, so I need to take care of chickens?
1/19/19, 11:15 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Ok
1/19/19, 11:15 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Do I need to leave seats?
1/19/19, 11:21 AM - Charles G: no
1/19/19, 11:22 AM - Charles G: he has an extra seat
1/19/19, 11:34 AM - Hannah Guedenet: It is really nice of him
1/19/19, 11:34 AM - Hannah Guedenet: I'm headed home
1/19/19, 11:35 AM - Hannah Guedenet: What are your plans for the afternoon
1/19/19, 11:35 AM - Charles G: going to Home depot soon. Want to come with me? :)
1/19/19, 11:35 AM - Charles G: what are you going to do? I'd also like to go for a run
1/19/19, 12:12 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Oh you forgot to tell your family your home!!!!
1/19/19, 12:12 PM - Charles G: oh yeah... Told everyone else! oops
1/21/19, 9:42 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Having luck?
1/21/19, 9:42 AM - Charles G: It should take them 40 minutes.
1/21/19, 9:42 AM - Charles G: Got my hat!
1/21/19, 9:43 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Nice work
1/21/19, 9:43 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Are you wanting to do the workout with me?
1/21/19, 9:43 AM - Hannah Guedenet: If so, you'll need to pick up loops from Julie. She has a set that Sara loaned her
1/21/19, 9:50 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Yes or no on workout?

1/24/19, 7:27 AM - Hannah Guedenet: i would be curious to know what it would cost for them to install a new dishwasher and remove the old one
1/24/19, 7:28 AM - Hannah Guedenet: hopefully that cost would come out of what we've already paid
1/24/19, 7:30 AM - Charles G: I have no idea. He tells this to the receptionist who tells me so I can't even ask him

1/24/19, 7:52 AM - Hannah Guedenet: also - i think we just give up on the Cabo idea for this year
1/24/19, 7:52 AM - Hannah Guedenet: your parents haven't responded and i don't want to keep pushing, so we should just drop it
1/24/19, 7:52 AM - Hannah Guedenet: i'm not even sure if they're interested in grandparents camp - maybe they would be interested if we made it the short week of july 4th, and we could go out wednesday night
1/24/19, 7:52 AM - Hannah Guedenet: we can talk tonight
1/24/19, 7:53 AM - Hannah Guedenet: i'm also just tired of nagging you to talk to your parents - not worth the effort anymore and it's obviously not a priority for you
1/24/19, 8:02 AM - Charles G: Ouch
1/24/19, 8:04 AM - Charles G: That was unfair and not true.
1/24/19, 8:04 AM - Charles G: I sent an email because I wanted them to think about it first before we talked
1/24/19, 8:05 AM - Charles G: I was planning to talk to them. We sisterly had different expectations on when

1/28/19, 9:10 AM - Charles G: yeah, it's annoying. I guess we're not suppose to use skype anymore
1/28/19, 9:12 AM - Hannah Guedenet: if you get bored - here are our cabos options:
1/28/19, 9:12 AM - Hannah Guedenet: http://www.haciendadelmar.com.mx/default-en.html
1/28/19, 9:12 AM - Hannah Guedenet: http://www.pueblobonitosunsetbeach.com/
1/28/19, 9:27 AM - Hannah Guedenet: ok - so i set it up so that $1000 comes out with each paycheck. and then an additional 600 comes out other times of the month (we already had that 600 coming out so it's really just the 1000 that is new)
1/28/19, 9:27 AM - Hannah Guedenet: we will give $100 to CRCC and then $200 to college savings
1/28/19, 9:27 AM - Hannah Guedenet: wait...the 1000 should only be monthly, not per pay check
1/28/19, 9:27 AM - Hannah Guedenet: i'll fix that
1/28/19, 9:48 AM - Hannah Guedenet: omg - this soup is so good

1/28/19, 9:56 AM - Hannah Guedenet: one last question - we have $13k in savings as of now. we could go ahead and pay off the retirement loan if you want. i guess it will depend how much the bathroom will cost

1/30/19, 5:03 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Here's another option
1/30/19, 5:03 AM - Hannah Guedenet: The views look amazing but it's a little more remote and we'd have to rent a car to get places it seems
1/30/19, 5:05 AM - Hannah Guedenet: And hey if the croissants don't look like they will turn out, I can buy some at Paul
1/30/19, 5:06 AM - Charles G: this looks so different from the others. Amazing views. It looks much more isolated...not a bad thing
1/30/19, 5:09 AM - Hannah Guedenet: It looks smaller too
1/30/19, 5:14 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Omg there was a homeless woman on k street. I passed by then went back and offered to call the shelter hotline. She did she tried but they kept passing by. She said she's going to get some tea and stay warm. I have her $10 and teared up. No one should be outside in this. And she was not one of the crazy ones. She was articulate. It means my heart
1/30/19, 5:14 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Breaks
1/30/19, 5:15 AM - Hannah Guedenet: I want to give money to pathways to housing
1/30/19, 5:16 AM - Hannah Guedenet: And I'm super early

1/30/19, 5:24 AM - Charles G: how awful. I can't believe she didn't get picked up. She could die in this cold
1/30/19, 5:24 AM - Charles G: I'll let you know about the croissants
1/30/19, 5:26 AM - Hannah Guedenet: I also just feel like such a petty person. Planning our vacation while this woman sleeps in sub freezing temps
1/30/19, 5:32 AM - Charles G: yeah, I know the feeling
1/30/19, 5:33 AM - Charles G: it's why I enjoyed volunteering at DCCK. It made me feel a little more connected to the "real world"
1/30/19, 5:33 AM - Hannah Guedenet: This isn't ok
1/30/19, 6:07 AM - Hannah Guedenet: My almond croissant looks a little sad
1/30/19, 6:18 AM - Charles G: Ours turned out yummy. Yours looks smaller than others...
1/30/19, 6:18 AM - Charles G: You done at the dentist?

1/30/19, 6:36 AM - Hannah Guedenet: What should I tell Kalai about the place in Cabo?
1/30/19, 6:50 AM - Hannah Guedenet: If c wants to play with Elise, I could pick her up a little early
1/30/19, 7:09 AM - Charles G: We need to discuss which place we want. Do u have a preference?
1/30/19, 8:01 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Did you tighten the toilet seats??
1/30/19, 8:02 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Also not going to say this where the girls can hear me, but if they're playing well maybe we take A to school a little later. Maybe at 11m
1/30/19, 8:02 AM - Hannah Guedenet: ?
1/30/19, 8:03 AM - Charles G: I tightened toilet seats
1/30/19, 8:03 AM - Charles G: I'm fine with that

2/16/19, 4:00 PM - Hannah Guedenet: LOVE those smiles!!!
2/16/19, 4:08 PM - Hannah Guedenet: This whole wedding has been a bit painful. The ceremony was a full church ceremony. Over an hour. And I'm just not feeling it
2/16/19, 4:18 PM - Hannah Guedenet: <Media omitted>
2/16/19, 5:27 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Wow this food is collosally bad. And they had no veg option for Allison and Paolo.

2/16/19, 5:32 PM - Hannah Guedenet: <Media omitted>
2/16/19, 5:32 PM - Hannah Guedenet: <Media omitted>
2/16/19, 5:50 PM - Charles G: Yeah, always liked the book if common prayer
2/16/19, 5:52 PM - Charles G: An hour long church ceremony?? So long. What do you know about the groom? He very religious?
2/16/19, 5:52 PM - Charles G: Also, you girls look great!!
2/16/19, 5:53 PM - Charles G: You especially although I still prefer without makeup
2/16/19, 6:02 PM - Hannah Guedenet: I don't know him at all but he seems really nice. Has a 10 year old daughter
2/16/19, 6:02 PM - Hannah Guedenet: We will be ordering pizza later
2/16/19, 6:02 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Food is awful
2/16/19, 6:07 PM - Hannah Guedenet: I feel awful because I can't remember our vows
2/16/19, 6:08 PM - Hannah Guedenet: You're very sweet
2/16/19, 6:09 PM - Hannah Guedenet: I just realized I've gone to two weddings in the past 6 months without you. This sucks
2/16/19, 6:13 PM - Charles G: What's the food?
2/16/19, 6:21 PM - Hannah Guedenet: It was rice chicken and canned green beans
2/16/19, 6:24 PM - Hannah Guedenet: The ceremony was just so devoid of anything special to them. Like you didn't get an idea of who they are as a couple
2/16/19, 6:25 PM - Hannah Guedenet: It was also interesting to think what would I do if I got married now at 36 versus 25. Not sure I would do the whole big deal with a church and reception and all
2/16/19, 6:52 PM - Charles G: I probably would not. I don't actually like weddings, I've decided
2/16/19, 6:57 PM - Hannah Guedenet: What???

3/5/19, 4:58 AM - Charles G: Parents, not pants
3/5/19, 5:19 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Oh that makes more sense. 😁

3/5/19, 5:20 AM - Hannah Guedenet: The cleaning folks come tomorrow
3/5/19, 5:20 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Actually can you text Wendy and confirm? I can't receive texts
3/5/19, 5:20 AM - Hannah Guedenet: I miss y'all
3/5/19, 5:20 AM - Hannah Guedenet: And I really dislike our m&e guy
3/5/19, 5:20 AM - Hannah Guedenet: He sucks
3/5/19, 6:27 AM - Hannah Guedenet: I'm feeling super overwhelmed right now. I have so much to do.
3/5/19, 6:31 AM - Charles G: I'm sorry babe. I feel the same way. And I have a week full of meetings.
3/5/19, 6:31 AM - Charles G: Walking to metro now
3/5/19, 6:31 AM - Charles G: Just trying to focus on what I can get done and celebrating small accomplishments
3/5/19, 7:15 AM - Hannah Guedenet: That's a good attitude to have.
3/5/19, 7:15 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Morning go ok?

3/5/19, 9:31 PM - Charles G: <Media omitted>
3/5/19, 11:38 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Oh babe. I can't believe you stayed up so late. You're going to be exhausted. Glad things for Benin are moving in a positive direction. Do you have dates for that? Can't believe you're taking two trips in the course of a few weeks.
3/5/19, 11:38 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Oh and don't forget the cleaners come tomorrow!!!
3/6/19, 4:47 AM - Charles G: Crap, alarm didn't go off. Bed to go into hyper speed
3/6/19, 4:47 AM - Charles G: Bed= need
3/6/19, 4:48 AM - Charles G: I have a pretty good idea and I think I can book my Tunisia tickets this week
3/6/19, 5:12 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Oh non!!!
3/6/19, 5:12 AM - Hannah Guedenet: I was just going to remind you to take off the sheets!!!
3/6/19, 6:09 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Two M&E highlights from my day. 1) turns out some of the numbers he presented yesterday are totally different than what we included in our results tracker last year for our annual report to Gates. In the tracker we put that 9000 women had accessed credit or savings. In his presentation, he put that we are only at 2300. 2) when asked why we don't have data for an indicator in our tracker, his response: because we haven't collected it over the four years. His whole job is to make sure we collect the right data!!!!!!
3/6/19, 6:09 AM - Hannah Guedenet: My head is going to explode
3/6/19, 7:09 AM - Charles G: Yikes. They haven't been collecting data on a gated indicator in four yrs and you're only finding out now?
3/6/19, 7:10 AM - Charles G: Finally on metro and guy next to me stinks do bad
3/6/19, 7:10 AM - Charles G: And my fingers are so cold, it's hard to type
3/6/19, 7:13 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Yes. Not good
3/6/19, 7:13 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Sorry babe. It has to warm up soon
3/6/19, 12:57 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Ugh. Another job Malia wasn't considered for. I don't get her email but I get people's responses to it
3/6/19, 1:01 PM - Charles G: what don't you get about her email? The fact that she sent it at all? I honestly would prefer that she update us on any progress.
3/6/19, 2:01 PM - Hannah Guedenet: No. I don't actually receive her messages. Not that I don't understand
3/6/19, 3:07 PM - Hannah Guedenet: I blocked her. Remember?
3/6/19, 3:16 PM - Hannah Guedenet: <Media omitted>
3/6/19, 8:45 PM - Charles G: Shoot, I thought the video was for me like yesterday, so I didn't share with the girls. I'll do that tomorrow
3/7/19, 1:10 AM - Hannah Guedenet: No worries. But I miss you. Hope you're ok

3/7/19, 4:13 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Good stuff in this article
3/7/19, 4:19 AM - Charles G: we do most of those things. We could start making our own toothpaste, I guess
3/7/19, 4:29 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Not a huge fan of that idea. You should use my deoderant
3/7/19, 4:29 AM - Hannah Guedenet: I feel better about the bulk stuff now that they have compost bags
3/7/19, 4:30 AM - Hannah Guedenet: You still went to bed late last night. You're a mess without me
3/7/19, 5:01 AM - Hannah Guedenet: You doing ok. Was sad not to have an update from you last nigjt
3/7/19, 5:23 AM - Charles G: Shoot, I thought it had sent. Weird.
3/7/19, 5:24 AM - Charles G: I could have sworn I took a video but don't see anything
3/7/19, 5:24 AM - Hannah Guedenet: ???
3/7/19, 5:24 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Wow you must be tired
3/7/19, 6:05 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Are you going to be able to finalize our taxes this weekend??
3/7/19, 6:23 AM - Charles G: Yes, very tired. I'll kind of a less but getting better. Went for a short run and will get in to the office early thanks to my parents
3/7/19, 6:23 AM - Charles G: I'm kind of a mess
3/7/19, 6:24 AM - Charles G: Yeah, I've been thinking about taxes. I'll add Schwab and do a review
3/7/19, 6:25 AM - Charles G: How's your day been? You sleeping alright?
3/7/19, 6:25 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Oh babe. Mess is not good
3/7/19, 6:25 AM - Hannah Guedenet: It's going. They are doing work on local value chains and I don't really have much to add. Still waking up at 4 am even with Ambien
3/7/19, 6:26 AM - Hannah Guedenet: So glad your parents came. Makes me feel a little better knowing you have some support
3/7/19, 6:27 AM - Charles G: Oh man, 4am? Well, by the time you go to adddis u should be adjusted
3/7/19, 6:27 AM - Hannah Guedenet: I was excited. Did 7 min workout this AM for first time in long time. I did all the push ups on my toes. 😁
3/7/19, 6:28 AM - Charles G: Awesome!!
3/7/19, 6:29 AM - Charles G: I'm going to give up sleep for Lent
3/7/19, 6:29 AM - Charles G: Ha, just kidding. Too easy
3/7/19, 6:29 AM - Hannah Guedenet: No sir
3/7/19, 6:29 AM - Hannah Guedenet: You should commit to going to bed by 10 for Lent
3/7/19, 6:29 AM - Charles G: Thought about that...not sure I can do it
3/7/19, 6:30 AM - Charles G: I think I'm going to do 20 minutes getting prayer a day.
3/7/19, 6:30 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Why not? That's the whole point of lent. Doing things we don't think we can do
3/7/19, 6:30 AM - Charles G: Centering, not getting
3/7/19, 6:31 AM - Charles G: There's going to be at least a day or two I'm going to have to work late. I have too much to do
3/7/19, 6:31 AM - Charles G: Sad, I know.
3/7/19, 6:33 AM - Hannah Guedenet: That's awful
3/7/19, 6:36 AM - Charles G: You're right. Ok, I'm doing it. 10pm bedtime until Easter
3/7/19, 6:37 AM - Charles G: It's going to be hard when I travel

3/7/19, 2:18 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Hey
3/7/19, 2:35 PM - Hannah Guedenet: I would really love if you could give me rough dates for your trips even if they are tentatuce
3/7/19, 2:51 PM - Hannah Guedenet: I'll see what I can do
3/7/19, 2:55 PM - Hannah Guedenet: <Media omitted>
3/7/19, 8:12 PM - Charles G: You look sexy.
3/7/19, 8:13 PM - Charles G: It was hard but I went to bed at 10. Going to read for a little now
3/7/19, 8:16 PM - Charles G: I sent dates but it looks like it didn't go through. For Tunisie, i travel the week if the 25th. For Benin, e week of April 15 but it's possible I'll need to go a couple days prior.

3/7/19, 8:36 PM - Charles G: The video quality gets better after first 30 seconds.
3/7/19, 8:36 PM - Charles G: BTW, Addie gives me more cuddles when you're gone
3/8/19, 12:16 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Thanks. Have you forgotten that we are going camping on the 19th of April? Do we have to cancel??
3/8/19, 12:17 AM - Hannah Guedenet: It's on the calendar.
3/8/19, 12:17 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Thanks for the videos and congrats on going to bed on time!!
3/8/19, 12:17 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Hope you slept well
3/8/19, 12:18 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Was the fender bender in our car or their Prius?
3/8/19, 12:18 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Have a good Friday and talk later
3/8/19, 12:29 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Also on your travel dates...would love to know when you're actually leaving for Tunisia. Haven't you bought a ticket??
3/8/19, 12:31 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Oh and the girls looks adorable. I didn't understand what was difficult in Charlotte's day. She was a little hard to understand. And Addie was super sweet.
3/8/19, 2:14 AM - Hannah Guedenet: And did you show Charlotte the video of Kryselda telling jokes?
3/8/19, 4:02 AM - Charles G: shoot, I may be able to leave Thursday but I wouldn't get home until Friday. Let's not cancel. Worse case scenario is that we miss the first night
3/8/19, 4:03 AM - Charles G: The prius and it's not a big deal...plastic on the back bumper lost some paint
3/8/19, 4:04 AM - Charles G: I did but we couldn't understand half of what she was saying so we didn't get the jokes. Maybe you can explain. Kryselda looked cute on the video though.
3/8/19, 4:31 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Well that would suck. Could you leave Wednesday night?
3/8/19, 6:18 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Are your parents leaving today?
3/8/19, 6:36 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Hey. What was the property assessment letter in yesterday's mail?!?!!
3/8/19, 7:46 AM - Charles G: Yeah, they're leaving today
3/8/19, 7:49 AM - Hannah Guedenet: You're killing me not answering about the assessment mail
3/8/19, 7:56 AM - Charles G: oh, that. No big deal. Just a list of properties bought and sold in TkPk over the last year
3/8/19, 7:57 AM - Charles G: It includes houses near the metro that really aren't comparable
3/8/19, 8:03 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Oh bummee
3/8/19, 10:16 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Hey you have a minute to chat. Was going to rest a bit and then work some more
3/8/19, 10:36 AM - Charles G: hey
3/8/19, 10:36 AM - Charles G: we should pick a platform, skype or whatsapp...
3/8/19, 10:36 AM - Charles G: 'you resting?
3/8/19, 10:37 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Well when I'm on my computer, Skype works better. But fine I'll stick to Whatsapp
3/8/19, 10:37 AM - Hannah Guedenet: I can talk for a few. Really want a short nap though
3/8/19, 10:37 AM - Charles G: I actually prefer skype. Whatsapp web stops working sometimes and I have to turn on my phone
3/8/19, 10:37 AM - Hannah Guedenet: We can talk later if now doesn't work
3/8/19, 10:38 AM - Hannah Guedenet: I don't have Skype on my phone
3/8/19, 10:38 AM - Charles G: let's talk. I was suppose to have a call right now but the person isn't shoring
3/8/19, 10:48 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Oh I need you to do me a favor. I have a dentist appmt on March 19 I won't be able to make. Can you call and move it for me to another Tuesday please???
3/8/19, 11:38 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Did you mean to call me?
3/8/19, 11:38 AM - Hannah Guedenet: I just woke up
3/8/19, 11:39 AM - Charles G: oh, hey. Just want to see if you still wanted to talk
3/8/19, 11:53 AM - Charles G: you have a dentist appointment on april 9 at 11:30am. It's on your google calendar. I hope that time works for you
3/8/19, 11:54 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Thanks babe. I'll make it work

3/8/19, 1:40 PM - Hannah Guedenet: you'll have to order your own pizza...sorry
3/8/19, 1:41 PM - Charles G: ok, that's fine. Thanks for trying 👍
3/8/19, 1:42 PM - Hannah Guedenet: but thanks for taking care of the dentist appmt for me

3/8/19, 1:44 PM - Hannah Guedenet: yay
3/8/19, 1:44 PM - Hannah Guedenet: i saw your email to blake
3/8/19, 1:44 PM - Hannah Guedenet: you didn't seem very happy in it
3/8/19, 2:01 PM - Hannah Guedenet: <Media omitted>
3/8/19, 2:03 PM - Charles G: yummy! That makes me want to have a salad now. We have lots of avocados too. Are you with Mary?
3/8/19, 2:03 PM - Hannah Guedenet: I am with Mary
3/8/19, 2:03 PM - Hannah Guedenet: There's salad in the fridge
3/8/19, 2:03 PM - Hannah Guedenet: And some roasted beets I think
3/8/19, 2:07 PM - Charles G: yep, and lots of beer
3/8/19, 2:08 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Man wish I was there
3/8/19, 2:26 PM - Hannah Guedenet: hey - did you talk to your dad about his La Ciotat rentals email?
3/8/19, 2:27 PM - Charles G: yeah, we talked a little about it. Why? He said he mostly had Melanie and her friends in mind
3/8/19, 2:27 PM - Hannah Guedenet: jsut curious - going through mye mail
3/8/19, 2:37 PM - Charles G: I had a "fun" call with the donor of the syria program. They are pissed with the delays but we've assuaged them somewhat by telling them that we're gonna threaten the contractor with a 50% reduction in the last payment if they don't agree to a new schedule that moves everything up by 10 days. Oh, for every day they're late, it's a 1% penalty on their payment. Ouch!
3/8/19, 2:37 PM - Charles G: the conversation with the contractor will be painful
3/8/19, 2:38 PM - Hannah Guedenet: You should have done that weeks ago!!!
3/8/19, 2:42 PM - Charles G: yes... That's what everyone keeps saying...
3/8/19, 2:42 PM - Hannah Guedenet: You gotta push them to get this done. But sorry you have the donor pressuring you now
3/8/19, 2:44 PM - Charles G: lesson learned from me...never again
3/8/19, 2:45 PM - Charles G: well shit. Flights to Tunis cost $4000 if I leave on Saturday
3/8/19, 2:45 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Shit
3/8/19, 2:45 PM - Charles G: I may have to leave Friday. Flights are $2300 if I leave then
3/8/19, 2:45 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Still so expensive
3/8/19, 2:45 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Ugh
3/8/19, 2:47 PM - Charles G: yeah
3/8/19, 3:20 PM - Charles G: could you give me Lisa's phone number?
3/8/19, 3:42 PM - Hannah Guedenet: +1.901.417.1688
3/8/19, 4:05 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Ugh there's some big party happening nearby. Loud music
3/8/19, 4:26 PM - Hannah Guedenet: And I can't believe I have another week and a day. I just want to come home.
3/8/19, 4:30 PM - Charles G: Sorry!!
3/8/19, 4:30 PM - Charles G: It'll go fast. Wish you were here too. Fridays without you are weird
3/8/19, 4:32 PM - Hannah Guedenet: <Media omitted>
3/8/19, 4:32 PM - Hannah Guedenet: That's me. Sad and all alone
3/8/19, 4:34 PM - Charles G: <Media omitted>
3/8/19, 4:40 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Ahhh! 😍
3/8/19, 4:40 PM - Hannah Guedenet: I had to look closely go see if it was a or c

3/8/19, 4:52 PM - Charles G: Ok, sleep well. 😘
3/9/19, 5:19 AM - Hannah Guedenet: So I'm not sure what it is about being away but it makes me reconsider what we're doing with our lives...
3/9/19, 5:29 AM - Hannah Guedenet: I still feel like we need a change...
3/9/19, 5:30 AM - Hannah Guedenet: I'm going to lunch in about an hour. Hopefully we could talk before then
3/9/19, 6:25 AM - Charles G: I'm awake now
3/9/19, 6:27 AM - Charles G: Sorry, you must be at lunch now. I slept horribly. I watched two episodes of umbrella academy academy and then couldn't fall asleep
3/9/19, 6:27 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Glad you got to sleep in
3/9/19, 6:27 AM - Hannah Guedenet: So you didn't go to bed at 10...
3/9/19, 6:28 AM - Hannah Guedenet: I also didn't sleep great. Didn't take an Ambien so wasn't asleep until almost 2
3/9/19, 6:28 AM - Hannah Guedenet: We're heading out in 2 mins
3/9/19, 6:29 AM - Charles G: Ok
3/9/19, 6:29 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Hopefully we can talk when I'm back
3/9/19, 6:29 AM - Charles G: That would be nice
3/9/19, 6:29 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Girls wake you up?
3/9/19, 6:29 AM - Charles G: Yep but they waited until 8:15
3/9/19, 6:30 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Very nice of them
3/9/19, 8:59 AM - Charles G: Hey, where's the black bean burrito recipe?
3/9/19, 9:09 AM - Hannah Guedenet: 2 cups of dried black beans
Diced onion, red pepper, green pepper, carrots 
2 cloves of garlic
2 tbsp chili seasoning
1 tbsp cumin
Salt
4 cups chicken broth
3/9/19, 9:09 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Cook on low for 8 hours
3/9/19, 9:12 AM - Charles G: Guess we're eating it tomorrow then. I'll do salmon cakes tonight
3/9/19, 9:12 AM - Charles G: Thanks
3/9/19, 9:31 AM - Hannah Guedenet: What time are Lisa and Ruthie arriving?
3/9/19, 9:31 AM - Hannah Guedenet: I'm back at the hotel if the girls want to talk
3/9/19, 9:31 AM - Hannah Guedenet: You could also cook the beans on high for 4 hours
3/9/19, 11:23 AM - Charles G: Where is the chicken broth? I can only find chicken stock
3/9/19, 11:23 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Same thinf
3/9/19, 11:23 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Should have said chicken stock
3/9/19, 11:31 AM - Charles G: Oh, ok
3/9/19, 11:49 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Pact is having a winter sale. Nice stuff if you need anything. And free shipping.
3/9/19, 11:49 AM - Hannah Guedenet: And we have that $20 off
3/9/19, 11:53 AM - Charles G: Cool. I'll take a look. I also get more banner ads with women in bras
3/9/19, 11:54 AM - Charles G: For black bean mix, what do you think of doing one hour on high and then 4 hours on low?
3/9/19, 11:55 AM - Hannah Guedenet: It won't cook
3/9/19, 11:55 AM - Hannah Guedenet: If you look at the men's clothes, maybe the banner will change?
3/9/19, 11:55 AM - Charles G: Ok, I'll do 4 hours on high
3/9/19, 11:55 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Yes
3/9/19, 11:57 AM - Charles G: That's what I did last time. They think I'm a woman. I wonder if in my account I said I was female.  I tend to lie when they ask.
3/9/19, 12:38 PM - Charles G: I was just listening to a French podcast about French culture and football. It made me want to move to France again
3/9/19, 12:52 PM - Hannah Guedenet: I had the same thought earlier today
3/9/19, 4:11 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Still up. Listening to a podcast and working on Hayden and Bailey's Afghan. Also just really want to be able to sleep...
3/9/19, 4:11 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Hope you and the girls have a fun evening with Lisa and Ruthie. Give them lots of hugs!!
3/9/19, 4:11 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Love you all so much and miss you.
3/9/19, 4:19 PM - Charles G: The girls each say they miss you at least once or twice a day
3/9/19, 4:19 PM - Charles G: <Media omitted>
3/9/19, 4:40 PM - Hannah Guedenet: I love them but they are so weird...
3/9/19, 4:40 PM - Hannah Guedenet: 🤣😂🤣😂🤣
3/9/19, 4:41 PM - Hannah Guedenet: I miss them so much too. I gushed about them at dinner tonight
3/9/19, 4:42 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Don't forget to change clocks!!
3/9/19, 4:42 PM - Hannah Guedenet: I'm going to bed. I love you so much babe
3/9/19, 4:43 PM - Charles G: <Media omitted>
3/9/19, 4:43 PM - Charles G: Yes, very weird
3/9/19, 4:43 PM - Charles G: Goodnight! Love you!
3/10/19, 4:04 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Ethiopian Airlines Flight Crashes Near Addis Ababa https://nyti.ms/2NTewYZ
3/10/19, 4:04 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Well shit
3/10/19, 4:31 AM - Charles G: Yeah, just saw that. Terrifying
3/10/19, 4:32 AM - Charles G: But still, extremely rare
3/10/19, 4:32 AM - Hannah Guedenet: I know. That's what Mary and I were discussing
3/10/19, 4:34 AM - Hannah Guedenet: But really doesn't make me want to get on an Ethiopian plane on Tuesday for 9 hours...
3/10/19, 4:34 AM - Charles G: We're still more likely to die in a car accident... Although that doesn't sound comforting...
3/10/19, 4:34 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Also did Ruthie and Lisa arrive. All going ok??
3/10/19, 4:34 AM - Hannah Guedenet: That's the same thing I said to Mary
3/10/19, 4:35 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Are y'all going to church?
3/10/19, 4:36 AM - Charles G: Yep, they arrived. We're going to church together. We may all go to a park in the afternoon. It's suppose to be nice weather
3/10/19, 4:36 AM - Charles G: They want to spend the day with us
3/10/19, 4:37 AM - Charles G: We also had a nice Skype chat with Malia and Sarah
3/10/19, 4:37 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Nice
3/10/19, 4:37 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Enjoy and send pics!!
3/10/19, 4:37 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Oh good. And MSU beat UofM last night
3/10/19, 4:38 AM - Charles G: Yeah, I can't believe I didn't watch the game!
3/10/19, 4:38 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Lisa had to send a letter to Shawn asking him to pay child support for Ruthie. Laid out how much he owed since he hasn't paid since the divorce was finalized in September. He responded by sending her $60. He owes at least $3000
3/10/19, 4:40 AM - Charles G: Is he broke or something?? $60? It's almost insulting. It would have been almost better if he hadn't sent anything
3/10/19, 4:41 AM - Charles G: M wants to come visit. I didn't know how to respond. I don't think she ever apologized to me for cancelling last time (or to the girls, for that matter)
3/10/19, 4:42 AM - Hannah Guedenet: He says he is...but I'm not sure he understands that the court will just take it out of his paycheck if he doesn't pay...
3/10/19, 4:42 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Ugh. No. Not going there again. And she needs to stop mentioning it to the girls.
3/10/19, 4:42 AM - Hannah Guedenet: What did you say?
3/10/19, 4:43 AM - Hannah Guedenet: And we don't have miles. We used them for Mexico
3/10/19, 4:43 AM - Charles G: She said it to me, not the girls, although they could hear
3/10/19, 4:45 AM - Charles G: She had also texted that earlier. I responded "sure, that would be nice". Sorry, maybe I should have been more honest?
3/10/19, 4:46 AM - Charles G: Is there a blueberry muffin recipe you use? I might make some
3/10/19, 4:47 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Yes you should have been
3/10/19, 4:47 AM - Hannah Guedenet: It would be nice if she would get on a plane and show up
3/10/19, 4:47 AM - Hannah Guedenet: I personally don't want her to come while you're gone and we don't have much time in the next few months that it would work
3/10/19, 4:48 AM - Hannah Guedenet: I'm not rearranging life for hwr
3/10/19, 4:48 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Her
3/10/19, 4:48 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Sorry I'm still really upset about it
3/10/19, 4:48 AM - Hannah Guedenet: http://smittenkitchen.com/2010/08/perfect-blueberry-muffins/
3/10/19, 4:48 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Now I really want a blueberry muffin
3/10/19, 4:54 AM - Charles G: Yeah, I'm not over it too. I'll say something next time she brings it up
3/10/19, 4:54 AM - Charles G: Thanks for the recipe!
3/10/19, 4:57 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Sorry babe. Feel like it's not really your job. Turns out you're having to be the one communicating with her. But at least she doesn't treat you like shit.
3/10/19, 4:58 AM - Hannah Guedenet: There are two Belgians staying at the guest house who are working on fgm issues here. It just makes me so uncomfortable for white people to work on that issue because it's so far outside our cultural understanding
3/10/19, 4:59 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Also they commented on my French. I just need to get over it.
3/10/19, 5:05 AM - Charles G: Yeah, in Benin we're working on "harmful cultural practices". I think it sounds a little insulting as if there's something wrong or broken about their culture that white people need to fix. I prefer that we talk about addressing early marriage and teen pregnancy
3/10/19, 5:08 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Yeah I talked to them about how we try to increase household communication. To me it seems like you have to start with that foundation to help them make this decision together
3/10/19, 5:08 AM - Hannah Guedenet: I miss you babe
3/10/19, 5:12 AM - Charles G: Miss you too
3/10/19, 6:11 AM - Hannah Guedenet: I'm supposed to fly Ethiopian from Addis to London on my way home. Can't do anything about the Ouaga to Addis flight but maybe I can change the return one
3/10/19, 6:11 AM - Hannah Guedenet: I'm checking with travel agent to see if I can change
3/10/19, 9:37 AM - Charles G: The plane model will be different. It's not the airline.
3/10/19, 10:30 AM - Hannah Guedenet: I know
3/10/19, 10:31 AM - Hannah Guedenet: I'm just having a hard time with it. Many people from WFP were on the plane.
3/10/19, 10:31 AM - Hannah Guedenet: How was church?
3/10/19, 10:33 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Your being much calmer about this than I am.
3/10/19, 10:33 AM - Hannah Guedenet: **you're
3/10/19, 10:44 AM - Charles G: I would be less calm if I was about to get on a plane
3/10/19, 10:44 AM - Charles G: Church was good. Matthew was on his A game. I hope you can see the video or listen to recording
3/10/19, 10:45 AM - Charles G: I saw Mike. It's not cancer. They was a relief
3/10/19, 10:45 AM - Charles G: That, not they
3/10/19, 10:45 AM - Charles G: Ok, off to make lunch now
3/10/19, 10:47 AM - Hannah Guedenet: What????
3/10/19, 10:47 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Oh Mike from church. Thought you meant coda's dadd
3/10/19, 10:48 AM - Charles G: Yes, that Mike
3/10/19, 10:48 AM - Hannah Guedenet: That's such a relief. Y'all should have gone out for lunch!
3/10/19, 10:50 AM - Charles G: Ethiopian for dinner
3/10/19, 10:50 AM - Charles G: Hey, how do you make fried rice?
3/10/19, 10:57 AM - Hannah Guedenet: I usually whip 2 eggs with a fork and add a little soy sauce and water. Cook that in the cast iron skillet. Take eggs out (cook it flat and then roll when done in the pan). Sauté some onion and garlic. And carrots in some oil. Then add rice and warm it. Add frozen peas and corn. And soy sauce. Then add back egg.
3/10/19, 10:57 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Or look up a recipe
3/10/19, 11:00 AM - Charles G: Awesome. Thanks
3/10/19, 11:10 AM - Hannah Guedenet: https://pca.st/4Igc
3/10/19, 11:10 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Listening to this. It's good. Would love to talk about it at some point
3/10/19, 11:10 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Good luck!
3/10/19, 11:49 AM - Hannah Guedenet: totally random - but now i want smart lights even more: https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/08/smarter-living/smart-lights-are-the-one-smart-home-gadget-for-everyone.html?fallback=0&recId=1IH7A2C7dCMy4NxJdKA0U5NRH3x&locked=0&geoContinent=AF&geoRegion=03&recAlloc=home-geo&geoCountry=BF&blockId=home-living-vi&imp_id=574047521&action=click&module=Smarter%20Living&pgtype=Homepage
3/10/19, 11:49 AM - Hannah Guedenet: we could dim our lights! or change their colors!!
3/10/19, 12:41 PM - Charles G: Did we argue a lot in your last trimester with Addie?
3/10/19, 12:42 PM - Hannah Guedenet: I was wondering the same thing?!?!
3/10/19, 12:43 PM - Hannah Guedenet: I feel like that is just placing way too much blame on mothers for how their kids turn out
3/10/19, 12:43 PM - Hannah Guedenet: I also wonder what he would think after 1 hour talking to us....
3/10/19, 12:44 PM - Hannah Guedenet: I liked the part about dads being really good at play
3/10/19, 12:45 PM - Charles G: Yeah, only 20 minutes in
3/10/19, 12:45 PM - Charles G: I should do our taxes now
3/10/19, 12:45 PM - Charles G: Very cool
3/10/19, 12:51 PM - Hannah Guedenet: That's about as far as I made it. Will listen more
3/10/19, 12:51 PM - Hannah Guedenet: I miss you
3/10/19, 12:52 PM - Hannah Guedenet: And the next few months are going to suck
3/10/19, 1:28 PM - Charles G: Yeah, just glanced at your email. My reaction: shit shit shit
3/10/19, 1:36 PM - Charles G: You know what's sad, I kind of wish I had the whole day to myself so that I could work. Im so far behind.
3/10/19, 1:40 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Oh babe. I'm so sorry. And going on two trips in the next month isn't going to help you catch up
3/10/19, 1:40 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Do we cancel or postpone our trip?
3/10/19, 1:41 PM - Charles G: Prepping for the trips is what I'm behind on so actually it will help
3/10/19, 1:42 PM - Charles G: I don't know. Can't think about it now
3/10/19, 1:42 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Ok
3/10/19, 1:42 PM - Hannah Guedenet: What are y'all up to?
3/10/19, 1:43 PM - Charles G: Going to park soon. What's the name of the park where C likes to bike?
3/10/19, 1:43 PM - Hannah Guedenet: I don't know. Four corners??
3/10/19, 1:43 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Why do you need the name?
3/10/19, 1:45 PM - Charles G: I can never remember how to get there
3/10/19, 1:47 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Ok. Go like you're going to church. But don't turn right on 29. Keep going straight. And about .5 mile down it will be on your right
3/10/19, 1:48 PM - Hannah Guedenet: North Four Corners Local Park
315 University Blvd W, Silver Spring, MD 20901, USA
+1 301-650-2600
https://maps.app.goo.gl/9EZ23
3/10/19, 1:51 PM - Charles G: Oh yeah. Thanks
3/10/19, 1:53 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Thank you for hosting Lisa and Ruthie despite all your stress. You're a super 🌟
3/10/19, 2:41 PM - Charles G: It's so nice to have them here.
3/10/19, 2:46 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Oh good
3/10/19, 2:46 PM - Hannah Guedenet: This podcast is good. I want to get this guy's book
3/10/19, 2:48 PM - Hannah Guedenet: https://www.amazon.com/Eight-Dates-Essential-Conversations-Lifetime/dp/1523504463
3/10/19, 3:30 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Ok going to bed. I am sorry we didn't get to talk more this weekend. And I really wanna listen to this podcast together and talk about it. The good thing I took away from it is that I don't think our relationship is on the brink of collapse. We have really good aspects to what makes us work and we just need to work on the weak spots. I do still think finding a therapist who can talk us through some of the strategies for resolving conflict or improving communication would be really helpful.
3/10/19, 4:24 PM - Charles G: Wow, you went to bed late!
3/10/19, 4:28 PM - Charles G: Did you think our relationship was on the brink of collapse? I should listen to the podcast. I agree with all your points though
3/10/19, 8:31 PM - Hannah Guedenet: 10:30 isn't that late. But now I'm awake. The time difference is only 4 hours now.
3/10/19, 8:32 PM - Hannah Guedenet: And in the podcast they talk about people going to counseling at the end of a relationship...that's what I was comparing to

3/11/19, 5:27 AM - Charles G: Thanks, babe. Walking to metro. Morning went fine. Yes, alarm went off
3/11/19, 5:39 AM - Charles G: I even got a run in today. I'm reminding myself of the buddest adage: it's not events that cause stress, it's our reaction to events. I'm choosing not to be stressed
3/11/19, 6:00 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Wow - nice work, babe. Both on the run and the positive attitude!
3/11/19, 6:00 AM - Hannah Guedenet: did you respond to aubin's texts??
3/11/19, 11:39 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Hey sexy. Hope you're having a good day!!
3/11/19, 2:19 PM - Charles G: Craziest day I've had in a long time. In my way home now
3/11/19, 2:21 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Can we talk for a few mins when you get the girls??
3/11/19, 2:21 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Crazy good or bad?
3/11/19, 2:23 PM - Charles G: We can try. I'm also picking up Kai. Aubin had to take Aria to urgent care
3/11/19, 2:25 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Oh jo
3/11/19, 2:25 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Ni
3/11/19, 2:25 PM - Hannah Guedenet: No
3/11/19, 2:25 PM - Hannah Guedenet: What's wrong with her??
3/11/19, 2:26 PM - Charles G: Just crazy. I went from Cali retreat discussion about big picture reflection, to benin research workshop with State department, to very strained conversation about Syria with contractor, back to confusing benin research workshop, then back to Cali retreat and 10 minute happy hour... Then finding out that Aria in urgent Care
3/11/19, 2:28 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Gosh babe
3/11/19, 2:29 PM - Charles G: I didn't even eat lunch
3/11/19, 2:30 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Wow. You must be exhausted
3/11/19, 2:30 PM - Charles G: I don't know. I just got an urgent message from kozue. I hope she's ok
3/11/19, 2:30 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Can you order something for dinner? Don't worry about the money
3/11/19, 2:30 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Well that's scary
3/11/19, 2:30 PM - Charles G: I don't know...maybe. I was going to make salmon caked
3/11/19, 2:45 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Hey you need anything specific from hungry harvest. Eggs? It will come Thursday
3/11/19, 2:45 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Also did you get back to aubin on if you need him to cover chickens this week?
3/11/19, 3:13 PM - Hannah Guedenet: So on my side I spent 10 hours in the office and Im still working...
3/11/19, 3:20 PM - Charles G: We talked this morning
3/11/19, 3:21 PM - Charles G: No, we have eggs, fruit, and veggied
3/11/19, 3:23 PM - Charles G: Sounds exhausting. Travel is often that way... You never stop working. I hope it's productive at least
3/11/19, 3:27 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Yeah it has been
3/11/19, 3:27 PM - Hannah Guedenet: You home yet?
3/11/19, 3:28 PM - Hannah Guedenet: I'll just send a video. Don't want to disrupt your evening
3/11/19, 3:31 PM - Charles G: I'm home. Making dinner
3/11/19, 3:31 PM - Charles G: Do you drain the salmon before mixing with other ingredients?
3/11/19, 3:31 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Yes
3/11/19, 3:31 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Do girls want say hi?
3/11/19, 3:31 PM - Hannah Guedenet: <Media omitted>
3/11/19, 3:31 PM - Charles G: Ok
3/11/19, 3:31 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Just sent a video
3/11/19, 3:33 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Ok what?
3/11/19, 3:33 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Not sure I can stay awake much longer. Do girls want to say hi?
3/11/19, 3:34 PM - Charles G: Hold on
3/11/19, 8:30 PM - Charles G: <Media omitted>
3/12/19, 12:58 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Thanks for the video. I know for you they were being exhausting but they were pretty cute
3/12/19, 12:58 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Hope the evening went ok.
3/12/19, 1:28 AM - Hannah Guedenet: I just realized that my passport is a little over a year old. And I have 5 visas in it...that's kind of insane.
3/12/19, 3:47 AM - Hannah Guedenet: I'm in Niger and my phone works. This plane is so crappy and cramped
3/12/19, 3:48 AM - Hannah Guedenet: I was going to work but I'm not sure I could open my laptop. The seats also don't have screens. I really think I want a new job. I can't keep doing this
3/12/19, 3:51 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Are you happy with what Blake sent? I guess I was imagining the colors would be more vibrant
3/12/19, 3:52 AM - Charles G: Yeah, they didn't go to bed until 9pm but it was the best I could do. It was also hair night
3/12/19, 3:52 AM - Charles G: Oh man, that sucks. Inter-African flights are the worst
3/12/19, 3:53 AM - Charles G: Haven't looked yet. Sorry
3/12/19, 3:58 AM - Charles G: Ok, I saw Blake's photo. I like the plywood more in this one. Don't know about vibrant colors.  You prefer the white plywood contrast?
3/12/19, 3:59 AM - Hannah Guedenet: A little. I'll have to go back and look
3/12/19, 4:00 AM - Hannah Guedenet: <Media omitted>
3/12/19, 4:00 AM - Hannah Guedenet: I'm feeling so claustrophobic
3/12/19, 4:01 AM - Hannah Guedenet: I want to cry
3/12/19, 4:02 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Babe I've tried to stay positive but I don't want to do this anymore
3/12/19, 4:23 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Hope you have a good, less crazy day. Love you
3/12/19, 5:55 AM - Charles G: Yeah, I'm trying to stay positive too but feel on the brink of panic sometimes. There's just too much going on. Next week should be better for me
3/12/19, 5:56 AM - Charles G: I'm so sorry, babe. This is a really long and hard trip. Hang in there. I love you so much.
3/12/19, 11:34 AM - Hannah Guedenet: I'm in Addis. The flight was so long. I have a raging headache. And horrible cramps. Why are we living our lives so stressed out and panicked??
3/12/19, 12:00 PM - Charles G: Thanks for the update. I was wondering how you were doing. You sound it bad shape. I'm so sorry, babe. I don't know why we put ourselves through this except that it's our job
3/12/19, 12:18 PM - Hannah Guedenet: The internet is really bad
3/12/19, 12:18 PM - Hannah Guedenet: We need new jobs
3/12/19, 12:48 PM - Hannah Guedenet: I'm so ready to come home. I think I'm having a hard time because I've already been gone a week and then traveled somewhere else! I can't do this again
3/12/19, 12:53 PM - Charles G: yeah, it's a lot of adjusting, time in airports, hotels, and all.
3/12/19, 12:53 PM - Charles G: it sucks. I'm ready for you to be home too!!!
3/12/19, 12:53 PM - Charles G: we all are. We're counting down the days
3/12/19, 7:34 PM - Charles G: You deleted this message
3/12/19, 7:39 PM - Charles G: <Media omitted>
3/12/19, 8:41 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Thanks for the video. You forgot to say I love you!! Well I love you and I know you love me
3/13/19, 1:54 AM - Hannah Guedenet: so....jenn (the gender expert doing this whole thing with me) is sick. i thought at first she was just being dramatic but by the time we finished breakfast she was a strange shade of green...and ended up rushing to the bathroom and throwing up. she was sick on her 2nd flight but thought she would be better. we've pushed off the training to this afternoon - I just hope she is better b/c I can't do a gender training on my own!!!
3/13/19, 1:56 AM - Hannah Guedenet: i'm freaking out a little
3/13/19, 1:56 AM - Hannah Guedenet: but i went through her presentation and think i can do most of it...
3/13/19, 3:05 AM - Charles G: Oh no. How awful!
3/13/19, 8:39 AM - Hannah Guedenet: well she is amazing
3/13/19, 8:39 AM - Hannah Guedenet: we ended up doing the conversation this afternoon
3/13/19, 8:39 AM - Hannah Guedenet: as painful as APMI is, we had a good conversation
3/13/19, 8:39 AM - Hannah Guedenet: how are things at home?
3/13/19, 9:54 AM - Charles G: Good, I'm glad it went well
3/13/19, 9:55 AM - Charles G: Morning with girls went fine but was then in nonstop meetings and now on my way home after wolfing down lunch
3/13/19, 9:56 AM - Hannah Guedenet: oh babe
3/13/19, 9:56 AM - Hannah Guedenet: you must be exhausted
3/13/19, 9:56 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Jenn is an amazing facilitator - and does such a stellar job with gender conversations. i feel like i learn so much from her every time
3/13/19, 9:57 AM - Hannah Guedenet: do you have a ticket to Tunisia yet?
3/13/19, 10:30 AM - Charles G: No and it's stressing me out. Apparently it's cheaper if the return is business class but it also requires additional approval. Vijitha needs to approve but she's out
3/13/19, 10:31 AM - Hannah Guedenet: BUSINESS??
3/13/19, 10:31 AM - Hannah Guedenet: NO WAY
3/13/19, 10:41 AM - Charles G: Yeah, on United but still...
3/13/19, 10:41 AM - Hannah Guedenet: united has nice business!
3/13/19, 10:42 AM - Hannah Guedenet: there's a cute pic of addie and ameer on lifecubby...
3/13/19, 10:42 AM - Charles G: It's assuming I get approvals. All the approval people are at a managers retreat
3/13/19, 10:42 AM - Hannah Guedenet: still leaving friday and returning saturday?
3/13/19, 10:47 AM - Hannah Guedenet: hey -- good luck with the appraisal guy and thanks so much for doing that
3/13/19, 10:49 AM - Charles G: thanks
3/13/19, 10:49 AM - Hannah Guedenet: i mean it
3/13/19, 10:49 AM - Hannah Guedenet: i really appreciate you doing that
3/13/19, 10:49 AM - Hannah Guedenet: i know it took a lot of time
3/13/19, 11:09 AM - Hannah Guedenet: no clue where the last three hours went
3/13/19, 11:09 AM - Hannah Guedenet: should head to bed soon
3/13/19, 12:08 PM - Hannah Guedenet: I love you. Night!!! Oh and give the girls hugs from me. 3 more sleeps!!! Miss you all so much!
3/13/19, 12:08 PM - Charles G: Thanks. Love you. I'll tell you about the visit later. Gotta go home and join call I'm already late for
3/13/19, 12:08 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Oh and let me know how the appraisal goes!
3/13/19, 12:08 PM - Hannah Guedenet: You already done??
3/13/19, 12:09 PM - Charles G: It went ok.  Depressing office. We'll hear back in 6-8 weeks
3/13/19, 12:10 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Got it.
3/13/19, 7:49 PM - Charles G: <Media omitted>

3/14/19, 2:59 AM - Hannah Guedenet: thanks for the video. you seem exhausted - i know the last two weeks have been as long for you as they have for me. and you're so amazingly strong
3/14/19, 2:59 AM - Hannah Guedenet: i ended up staying up late last night reading a book that mary had been reading in burkina - it was fabulous
3/14/19, 3:00 AM - Hannah Guedenet: i hope you have a great thursday - almost the end of the week!
3/14/19, 3:05 AM - Charles G: Hey, you're pretty tough yourself. You're also sounding much chipper? What's the book? I need a good one to read
3/14/19, 7:10 AM - Hannah Guedenet: It's called educated. mind blowing.
3/14/19, 7:10 AM - Hannah Guedenet: I'm ok. We have a good action plan for working with Silverlands. Challenge is that someone needs to go out there in June. And I don't think it will be me.
3/14/19, 7:26 AM - Hannah Guedenet: I'm having dinner with Amanda from Zimbabwe

3/14/19, 9:27 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Poor c looked so sad. Sorry she didn't get to read her book. And for some reason the video was upside down.
3/14/19, 9:28 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Wow. Thanks for the sweet words babe. I miss you so much too. I feel so outside of myself here. My whole life is just work. I miss my other routines that make me who I am. And I miss having you by my side.
3/14/19, 9:36 PM - Hannah Guedenet: I just saw on Kristen Bell's Instagram that Dax is on the latest story pirates episode (she did this funny video about jealousy in a marriage and got all teary eyed...it was pretty great). So don't listen to it without me!!!!
3/14/19, 9:36 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Also how'd the call for church go?
3/14/19, 9:36 PM - Hannah Guedenet: 1 MORE SLEEP!!
3/15/19, 5:30 AM - Charles G: Hello!
3/15/19, 5:31 AM - Charles G: The church call is aboyt the poverty and hunger discussions. Jennifer and Will were on it. We have no idea how many will come...it could 5 people or 20 people

3/15/19, 8:02 AM - Hannah Guedenet: And omg I'm done with my last meeting!!! Having dinner with AV staff then I can head home!!
3/15/19, 8:08 AM - Charles G: oh my goodness. That's awful! I can't imagine he was that old. Ladd is about our age or a little older, right?

3/15/19, 11:33 AM - Hannah Guedenet: No he was older. Ladd is 50. Have you not met her? Showering and getting ready to go. Had a fun evening. Will send more in a bit
3/15/19, 12:32 PM - Hannah Guedenet: <Media omitted>
3/15/19, 12:33 PM - Charles G: I guess I don't remember what she looks like
3/15/19, 12:34 PM - Charles G: Nice video :)
3/15/19, 12:34 PM - Charles G: When does your plane leave?
3/15/19, 12:34 PM - Hannah Guedenet: 1:20 am
3/15/19, 12:35 PM - Hannah Guedenet: i have a headache - drank two beers which was a bad idea
3/15/19, 12:35 PM - Hannah Guedenet: i was just so relieved to be done

3/15/19, 12:43 PM - Charles G: It's going ok. I put off a lot of things to today... Probably too much. I will just do what I can and apologize for being late, per the usual

3/15/19, 2:19 PM - Charles G: I may just have her nap and then do something just the two of us

3/18/19, 2:42 PM - Charles G: Oh man. I bet c was not happy
3/19/19, 5:29 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Message from Amy about the WFF position - Sorry, was on my way to dinner last night. I'll see if I can get the scoop on the position this week. Charles might also look up the Eval director, Marc Holley, and read some of the stuff he's written. WFF's evaluation culture is about exactitude but not truth, IMO, though maybe this position is supposed to help modernize us. Anyway, will let you know what I find out
3/19/19, 2:09 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Omg. What a day
3/19/19, 2:53 PM - Charles G: You'll have to tell me about it. I'm on the metro
3/19/19, 2:53 PM - Charles G: Interesting comment about exactitude but not truth
3/19/19, 2:57 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Where are you now? We're leaving school
3/19/19, 2:58 PM - Charles G: Il attend NOMA
3/19/19, 2:58 PM - Charles G: I'm at NOMA

3/20/19, 8:50 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Just FYI - i cancelled our amazon family music account but it is in affect until April 1. i would like to move to Spotify - i will get us a premium family account starting April 1 for the same cost
3/20/19, 3:06 PM - Charles G: Ok on Spotify move
3/20/19, 3:07 PM - Charles G: I left office late... I'll try biking home
3/20/19, 3:12 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Ok
3/20/19, 3:15 PM - Charles G: I had another disagreement with Vijitha over email. I need to schedule a time tomorrow for us to talk. I also want to talk to Jill for advice.

3/21/19, 2:58 PM - Hannah Guedenet: We might have a fend for yourself dinner...I feel like crap. Stomach hurts and headache
3/21/19, 3:02 PM - Charles G: Ok. Sounds good to me. We have those yummy ramen noodles.
3/21/19, 3:03 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Yeah that's what I was thinking
3/21/19, 3:03 PM - Charles G: Or should I get sardi?
3/21/19, 3:03 PM - Hannah Guedenet: No we don't need Sardis. Ramen will be good
3/21/19, 3:16 PM - Charles G: Yeah, that's what I was thinking
3/22/19, 1:19 PM - Charles G: Just realized I still have my contacts in.
3/22/19, 1:19 PM - Charles G: And my throat is really sore
3/22/19, 1:19 PM - Charles G: Blah. I wish I was home
3/22/19, 1:20 PM - Charles G: Only good news is that I got an  aisle seat in economy plus
3/22/19, 1:47 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Oh nice! Not the sore throat
3/22/19, 2:06 PM - Hannah Guedenet: What time are you leaving?
3/22/19, 3:23 PM - Charles G: Not until 7:40 now. I hope I make my connection to Tunis. It's going to be tight
3/22/19, 3:46 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Yikrs
3/22/19, 4:27 PM - Hannah Guedenet: We're still at this KA thing. And it's not helping my headache...
3/22/19, 4:27 PM - Charles G: Getting ready for takeoff. I loved the umbrella photos 😍
3/22/19, 4:28 PM - Charles G: Sorry!
3/22/19, 4:33 PM - Charles G: Ok. Turning off phone. Love you so much. Bon courage this week. 💕
3/22/19, 4:39 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Love you!
3/22/19, 7:03 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Thanks for the card and the fire. You're so wonderful. I love you
3/23/19, 12:59 AM - Charles G: Did the fire actually work?
3/23/19, 12:59 AM - Charles G: Missed my connection so it's going to be a long day in munich
3/23/19, 1:00 AM - Charles G: Il fly to milan in 6 hours and then to Tunis
3/23/19, 5:06 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Oh no!!
3/23/19, 5:36 AM - Hannah Guedenet: You still munich
3/23/19, 5:47 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Did you get us a new sponge??
3/23/19, 5:47 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Ugh!!! You didn't get the right sponge!
3/23/19, 5:47 AM - Hannah Guedenet: I hate these dobie ones. I wanted the cloth one like we had before
3/23/19, 5:48 AM - Hannah Guedenet: 😑
3/23/19, 6:49 AM - Hannah Guedenet: We need a new waffle maker. They keep getting stuck
3/23/19, 6:58 AM - Charles G: I know but they didn't have the good ones we like
3/23/19, 6:58 AM - Charles G: Ok on getting new waffle maker. They're cheap
3/23/19, 6:59 AM - Hannah Guedenet: You have to know where to look
3/23/19, 6:59 AM - Hannah Guedenet: I'll get one
3/23/19, 7:41 AM - Charles G: Getting on my plane to milan now
3/23/19, 7:42 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Ugh you unplugged the Alexa so now it only works if tv is on
3/23/19, 7:42 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Safe flight babe
3/23/19, 7:45 AM - Charles G: Huh?
3/23/19, 7:45 AM - Charles G: Gotta go. Love you!!
3/23/19, 7:47 AM - Hannah Guedenet: The power strip we have behind the TV has certain plugs that only turn on when the tv is on to save power. You plugged the Alexa into one of these plugs to plug in your light
3/23/19, 7:47 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Nevers mind
3/23/19, 7:55 AM - Hannah Guedenet: I don't know how you come up with fun things to do with the girls. I'm such a dud of a parent
3/23/19, 8:34 AM - Hannah Guedenet: And I ended up with them both in tears...
3/23/19, 10:15 AM - Charles G: Oh babe, sorry. It's a lot harder to be fun with the girls when you're on your own, have to make, and all
3/23/19, 10:16 AM - Charles G: Im still in Milan. There's another delay and they're not sure they have our suitcases
3/23/19, 10:21 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Oh no!!!
3/23/19, 10:21 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Glad you have a extra day
3/23/19, 10:27 AM - Hannah Guedenet: What is causing the delays??
3/23/19, 10:37 AM - Charles G: In DC, the plane was late. In Milan... We're in Italy?
3/23/19, 10:38 AM - Charles G: It seems they do have our bags though do that's good.
3/23/19, 10:38 AM - Charles G: I'm on the plane too
3/23/19, 10:38 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Ha
3/23/19, 10:38 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Phew. What a long day. I'm sorry babe. How long is the flight?
3/23/19, 10:41 AM - Charles G: I think 2 hours...almost there
3/23/19, 12:17 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Btw. We have to get rid of these sheets. They are bally everywhere now
3/23/19, 12:17 PM - Hannah Guedenet: I hate them
3/23/19, 12:46 PM - Charles G: Ok on the sheets. I'm in Tunis
3/23/19, 1:18 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Yay!
3/23/19, 2:45 PM - Charles G: I'm finally settled in bed. It feels so good to be clean. Can we try talking tomorrow?
3/23/19, 2:46 PM - Charles G: Love you. Enjoy your Saturday. 😙
3/23/19, 2:47 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Love you too. Sleep well! Lets talk tomorrow. Get some rest
3/23/19, 7:30 PM - Hannah Guedenet: <Media omitted>
3/23/19, 11:58 PM - Charles G: Thanks for the video. Hope church was good. I slept beautifully
3/24/19, 4:16 AM - Charles G: Hey, when are you all gonna be around to Skype with?
3/24/19, 5:04 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Just now waking up. Didn't sleep great. Nutella came in at least 3 times meowing. And she has food. I want to kill her. Girls are still in bed
3/24/19, 5:05 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Then we're going to church and getting the girls hair cut. We can try this morning or later today. What are your plans?
3/24/19, 5:26 AM - Charles G: Going to lunch now. How about after church? After lunch, going to hotel to work
3/24/19, 6:10 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Ok enjoy
3/24/19, 6:11 AM - Hannah Guedenet: We can try after church
3/24/19, 9:28 AM - Charles G: The lunch has turned into a shopping your with colleague. Ugh...
3/24/19, 9:20 AM - Hannah Guedenet: We should give to HI for the cyclone relief in Moz
3/24/19, 9:33 AM - Hannah Guedenet: No worries. Were rushing to eat lunch and get hair cut
3/24/19, 9:33 AM - Hannah Guedenet: What colleague? From DC?
3/24/19, 9:44 AM - Charles G: Il with two DC colleagues and one expat
3/24/19, 10:07 AM - Hannah Guedenet: <Media omitted>
3/24/19, 10:12 AM - Charles G: Oh cool. Nice emoji. Does that mean it'll be less thick? Is she getting it shortened too?
3/24/19, 10:30 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Yes less thick and yes shortened
3/24/19, 10:41 AM - Hannah Guedenet: And of course that's how your mother responds... 🙄
3/24/19, 11:27 AM - Hannah Guedenet: We're back at the house but taking rests. Talk when everyone gets up?
3/24/19, 11:46 AM - Charles G: Yeah, just let me know. I may get dinner quickly
3/24/19, 1:01 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Also just ignite everything I said about my picks...I had a good first day and now you're beating me
3/24/19, 1:02 PM - Hannah Guedenet: I'll get Addie up in a bit if you're around
3/24/19, 1:05 PM - Charles G: Give me 5 minutes to go back to my room
3/24/19, 1:16 PM - Charles G: Ready!
3/24/19, 1:16 PM - Charles G: I stopped to get a gelato
3/24/19, 1:27 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Let me get Addie up
3/24/19, 1:30 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Ok we're ready
3/24/19, 1:30 PM - Hannah Guedenet: We're on WhatsApp
3/24/19, 1:58 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Also I honestly don't know how to take your mom's message about Char's hair. Ugh
3/24/19, 4:08 PM - Charles G: I wouldn't think too much about it. It did seem like maybe she would rather we hadn't done it but i don't really care. It's like, you know, just her opinion, man...
3/24/19, 4:09 PM - Charles G: Going to bed now. I got a lot done and feel good about the week
3/24/19, 4:09 PM - Hannah Guedenet: You poop. You made me smile
3/24/19, 4:09 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Sleep well and I'm glad to hear
3/24/19, 4:11 PM - Charles G: <Media omitted>
3/24/19, 7:53 PM - Hannah Guedenet: I love you nerd and
3/24/19, 7:53 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Miss you much
3/25/19, 3:56 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Morning babe! When you get a chance can you confirm that you have taken out cash 4 times since leaving?? Just seems like a lot so wanted to make sure. Hope the training is going well
3/25/19, 5:38 AM - Charles G: Yes, that sounds abut right. Needed to withdraw money to pay hotel and I had to make several withdrawals because limits on how much I can out at one time.
3/25/19, 5:47 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Ok
3/25/19, 9:42 AM - Charles G: Il going to the massive arts and crafts sale. Speak now if there's anything you think I should look for
3/25/19, 9:42 AM - Charles G: I'm thinking round table cloths, pretty pottery as gifts
3/25/19, 9:42 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Haha good luck!!
3/25/19, 9:42 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Something for your sis
3/25/19, 9:42 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Hope the day went well
3/25/19, 9:42 AM - Hannah Guedenet: I've spent day in bed. I'm still not feeling well
3/25/19, 11:14 AM - Charles G: I bought a lot of stuff but prices were set and very reasonable
3/25/19, 11:14 AM - Charles G: Stuff I got would sell for about 5  times as much in US
3/25/19, 11:15 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Nice work babe
3/25/19, 11:15 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Long day for you though. Did the training go well?
3/25/19, 11:16 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Your sis and Eric could always take an Uber if they're worried. Mornings are a bit nuts for us...
3/25/19, 11:18 AM - Charles G: Long day but a good one. It's nice to get all the shopping out of the way
3/25/19, 11:18 AM - Charles G: But sure what we will give as present. I like everything I got
3/25/19, 11:19 AM - Hannah Guedenet: I'm very impressed
3/25/19, 11:36 AM - Hannah Guedenet: And I'm glad you applied for that job. I read your cover letter - that was impressive. I think I often forget what an amazing writer you are
3/25/19, 11:56 AM - Charles G: That cover letter is the product of many revisions over the last year or so. I just needed to tweak it for this job
3/25/19, 11:56 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Well it read as very genuine
3/25/19, 11:56 AM - Charles G: Thanks for the compliment 😊
3/25/19, 11:56 AM - Hannah Guedenet: I will steal it when I start applying for jobs...
3/25/19, 12:01 PM - Charles G: hahaha. That would be very flattering
3/25/19, 12:02 PM - Charles G: you mean IF you start applying, right?
3/25/19, 12:02 PM - Hannah Guedenet: I don't know. I'm really struggling right now
3/25/19, 12:02 PM - Hannah Guedenet: I'm just so tired.
3/25/19, 12:05 PM - Charles G: yeah, I get that. Maybe start reflecting on whether your feeling of exhaustion and being overwhelmed is a temporary thing or something that has or will become more of a constant?
3/25/19, 12:06 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Yeah. I should reflect more. I'm going to some of the lent day of quiet on Saturday. If Hamadi takes girls I could be there by 1:30 and leave when it's over at 3:30
3/25/19, 12:07 PM - Charles G: oh, nice! good idea. I'm jealous
3/25/19, 12:07 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Yeah 2 hours is still better than none
3/25/19, 12:22 PM - Charles G: yeah, 2 hours just to reflect in peace with no distractions...priceless
3/25/19, 12:25 PM - Charles G: ugh...the Benin trip is going to kill me
3/25/19, 12:25 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Oh no...
3/25/19, 12:25 PM - Charles G: there are no flights out of benin on Thursday the 18th
3/25/19, 12:25 PM - Hannah Guedenet: 😑
3/25/19, 12:26 PM - Hannah Guedenet: So no camping trip...
3/25/19, 12:26 PM - Hannah Guedenet: We'll figure out something fun to do when you're back
3/25/19, 12:26 PM - Hannah Guedenet: And plan another camping trip
3/25/19, 12:27 PM - Charles G: shit, the travel agent also has me leaving on Monday!
3/25/19, 12:27 PM - Charles G: no, you should go!!
3/25/19, 12:27 PM - Charles G: nevermind, camping by yourself with girls...exhausting
3/25/19, 12:28 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Leaving where on Monday?
3/25/19, 12:28 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Not going camping alone
3/25/19, 12:29 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Packing everything driving setting up tent. You're a crazy man for even suggesting it
3/25/19, 12:29 PM - Charles G: I asked for an itinerary that had me leaving on the 9th and coming back Friday. She came back with an itinerary that had me leaving the 8th and coming back saturday
3/25/19, 12:29 PM - Charles G: that's why I said nevermind afterwards
3/25/19, 12:33 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Maybe there aren't flights to Benin every day.
3/25/19, 12:33 PM - Hannah Guedenet: This sucks.
3/25/19, 12:33 PM - Charles G: there aren't
3/25/19, 12:33 PM - Charles G: that's the problem
3/25/19, 12:35 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Ugh
3/25/19, 12:36 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Oh and I thought you were just gone the 15-18. You're going to be gone 10 days???
3/25/19, 12:36 PM - Hannah Guedenet: You never told me that. I thought we had 2 weeks with you when you get back
3/25/19, 12:37 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Omg
3/25/19, 12:48 PM - Charles G: i told you I had to go a couple days before the training started for a ToT
3/25/19, 12:48 PM - Charles G: I'm going to see if I can do the ToT over the weekend
3/25/19, 12:48 PM - Hannah Guedenet: I don't remember that conversation
3/25/19, 12:48 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Doesn't matter at this point. It all just sucks
3/25/19, 12:48 PM - Charles G: it was probably over whatsApp
3/25/19, 12:49 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Can you look into cancelling our camping trip
3/25/19, 12:49 PM - Hannah Guedenet: And let the neighbors know
3/25/19, 12:49 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Please
3/25/19, 12:59 PM - Charles G: yeah
3/25/19, 1:02 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Thanks
3/25/19, 1:03 PM - Hannah Guedenet: I guess I'm most annoyed our camping trip is getting messed by a project you don't even like. And the fact that our trip can get messed up. It feels like we can't set any boundaries with our job. This was the first family vacation we had planned in a long time.
3/25/19, 1:09 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Not sure if that makes sense
3/25/19, 1:34 PM - Charles G: yeah, it makes sense
3/25/19, 1:36 PM - Charles G: I'm just so sick of this job right now
3/25/19, 1:38 PM - Charles G: I'm also seeing if I can make it work for me to leave Thursday by adding another layover. Maybe I could go to Addis first and then to Europe? I don't know...there might be a way
3/25/19, 2:21 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Sorry babe. To whatever will get you there fastest
3/25/19, 2:21 PM - Hannah Guedenet: You should go to bed. Going to get the girls in a few.
3/25/19, 2:21 PM - Charles G: ok. I'll send a video
3/25/19, 2:22 PM - Charles G: i love you
3/25/19, 2:22 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Love you too. Sleep well!!
3/25/19, 3:18 PM - Charles G: You deleted this message
3/25/19, 3:18 PM - Charles G: For the girls
3/25/19, 3:19 PM - Charles G: <Media omitted>
3/25/19, 3:49 PM - Charles G: <Media omitted>
3/25/19, 5:21 PM - Hannah Guedenet: <Media omitted>
3/25/19, 5:21 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Long video from your 3 ladies
3/25/19, 6:42 PM - Hannah Guedenet: <Media omitted>
3/26/19, 5:51 AM - Hannah Guedenet: So I think my headaches are allergy related. Took one of the Allegra D this morning when I had a headache starting and it's gone. Still doesn't explain my stomach stuff but does explain my general crappy feeling
3/26/19, 9:36 AM - Charles G: Hey there. Finishing up my day here. Glad you figured out the headaches. I have stomach problems
3/26/19, 10:09 AM - Hannah Guedenet: oh no
3/26/19, 10:09 AM - Hannah Guedenet: stomach problems how so?
3/26/19, 10:27 AM - Charles G: Liquid stools
3/26/19, 10:31 AM - Hannah Guedenet: do you have pepto?
3/26/19, 10:31 AM - Hannah Guedenet: and any crmaping?
3/26/19, 10:32 AM - Hannah Guedenet: i am really sorry
3/26/19, 10:44 AM - Charles G: No. I don't have cramping at least
3/26/19, 11:14 AM - Hannah Guedenet: i'm sorry
3/26/19, 11:14 AM - Hannah Guedenet: how did your day go?
3/26/19, 11:24 AM - Charles G: Pretty good. I'm learning a lot about training design and from my colleagues who have more experience
3/26/19, 11:25 AM - Charles G: Il attend a taco place right now.
3/26/19, 11:25 AM - Charles G: Im attend a taco place. There's a sushi place nearby too. Very international
3/26/19, 11:26 AM - Charles G: Dang it...stupid autocorrect
3/26/19, 11:45 AM - Hannah Guedenet: I have no idea what you're trying to say
3/26/19, 11:49 AM - Hannah Guedenet: but glad it is going well
3/26/19, 2:01 PM - Hannah Guedenet: omg - good thing i looked closely at the email from the dentist office
3/26/19, 2:01 PM - Hannah Guedenet: my dentist appointment is on the 9th
3/26/19, 2:02 PM - Hannah Guedenet: you put it on the calendar for the 2nd
3/26/19, 2:02 PM - Hannah Guedenet: <Media omitted>
3/26/19, 3:22 PM - Hannah Guedenet: You still awake
3/26/19, 3:56 PM - Charles G: Going to sleep now. Sorry!!!! Not sure how that happened. Weird
3/26/19, 3:57 PM - Charles G: BTW, I got email saying  that we haven't registered for KAA yet.
3/26/19, 3:58 PM - Hannah Guedenet: I submitted the form. Did you get a paper form?
3/26/19, 3:59 PM - Hannah Guedenet: And I'm so sorry about benin
3/26/19, 3:59 PM - Charles G: I don't remember one
3/26/19, 4:00 PM - Charles G: I would love it if my role we're reduced... Just need to make it official
3/26/19, 4:01 PM - Charles G: But yes, it's lousy
3/26/19, 4:02 PM - Hannah Guedenet: I would too
3/26/19, 4:02 PM - Hannah Guedenet: I really hope you don't miss Easter
3/26/19, 4:02 PM - Charles G: Love you
3/26/19, 4:02 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Love you too. Sleep well
3/26/19, 4:04 PM - Charles G: There's no way I'm missing Easter. I have to draw the line Somewhere. Plus, it's not necessary
3/27/19, 3:50 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Oh shoot. Forgot to tell you that Addie asked for a video from you. Can you send one some time today?
3/27/19, 6:39 AM - Charles G: Yes, definitely!
3/27/19, 6:40 AM - Hannah Guedenet: well maybe send it to your parents since i won't see the girls tonight
3/27/19, 7:16 AM - Hannah Guedenet: how's your day going?
3/27/19, 7:34 AM - Hannah Guedenet: <Media omitted>
3/27/19, 8:36 AM - Charles G: Ok. Will do
3/27/19, 8:38 AM - Charles G: Enjoying the workshop but keeping thinking about Benin. More issues with Vijitha have  up. I'm trying to draft a response
3/27/19, 8:38 AM - Hannah Guedenet: OMG
3/27/19, 8:38 AM - Hannah Guedenet: how do more issues come up?? you're not even there?!?
3/27/19, 8:38 AM - Hannah Guedenet: oh babe i'm sos orry
3/27/19, 9:28 AM - Hannah Guedenet: so i forgot to include in my email that i talked to ana yesterday about some of my upcoming travel and trying to get out of it...no luck
3/27/19, 9:28 AM - Hannah Guedenet: seems i can't get out of any of it
3/27/19, 1:38 PM - Hannah Guedenet: so your parents arrived 20 mins ago. they said they would be here around 5 so i had closed my eyes for a few minutes and all of a sudden, someone was in my house. your mom's voice sounded like a child and i was so disoriented!!!
3/27/19, 2:23 PM - Charles G: hey. Just came back from a fancy dinner with colleagues. I've eaten pretty well here
3/27/19, 2:24 PM - Charles G: I guess you needed that nap!
3/27/19, 2:25 PM - Charles G: that's not good. I'm sorry. :(
3/27/19, 2:30 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Yay glad there's something positive happening. I'm so worried about you
3/27/19, 2:39 PM - Hannah Guedenet: I'm headed to the Hope event. Your parents are picking up girls
3/27/19, 2:39 PM - Hannah Guedenet: I'm a little late but oh well
3/27/19, 4:41 PM - Charles G: I hope the hope event went well. Another late night for me and I have a long day Thursday. Wish me luck. Love you!
3/27/19, 5:08 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Love you!! Good event and having dinner with Allison!
3/27/19, 7:22 PM - Hannah Guedenet: I had a really good night. Al and I went to this place that had a 3 course meal and cocktail for $25. And it was delicious!!!
3/27/19, 7:26 PM - Hannah Guedenet: The girls seemed to have had a good time with your parents. Apparently c got upset because the black bean burrito wasn't folded the right way and ended up in tears. I explained to your parents that often when she is like that, there's something deeper causing her to be upset. In this case, she is used to us being together for burritos. And used to us folding them a certain way. And she just loves us being together. I think we need to more and more help her find words for her feelings.
3/27/19, 10:03 PM - Charles G: Oh man. Poor c
3/27/19, 10:03 PM - Charles G: $25?! That's crazy
3/28/19, 4:27 AM - Hannah Guedenet: You mean crazy cheap right? A cocktail alone costs $12
3/28/19, 5:52 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Ugh having your parents there this AM didn't work. Addie was all out of sorts and would not eat breakfast. I'm just now getting to metro.
3/28/19, 5:52 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Hope your day is going well
3/28/19, 7:17 AM - Hannah Guedenet: i just wanted you to know...i miss you horribly
3/28/19, 7:17 AM - Hannah Guedenet: this sucks.
3/28/19, 7:17 AM - Hannah Guedenet: it's not the same without you around.
3/28/19, 7:17 AM - Hannah Guedenet: and i know this will sound weird - on one level, i am able to function w/o you - i get all the tasks done and i manage. but it's lonely and exhausting. i never want to do it without you
3/28/19, 7:17 AM - Hannah Guedenet: i get what you meant when i was gone. i miss your physical presence
3/28/19, 7:18 AM - Hannah Guedenet: <Media omitted>
3/28/19, 11:11 AM - Hannah Guedenet: are you alive?!!?
3/28/19, 11:12 AM - Hannah Guedenet: i hate when i don't hear from you for 8+ hours...not sure how to get that through to you
3/28/19, 11:12 AM - Hannah Guedenet: PLEASE CHECK IN FROM TIME TO TIME
3/28/19, 11:13 AM - Charles G: I'm here!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
3/28/19, 11:14 AM - Charles G: I miss you too!! And I am so tired. I felt like my IQ dropped a few points today. I felt mentally slower than usual.
3/28/19, 11:14 AM - Charles G: sorry, it's been an intense day of workshops followed by a skype call with people in DC.
3/28/19, 11:23 AM - Hannah Guedenet: any improvement on the benin front?
3/28/19, 11:24 AM - Hannah Guedenet: i'm sure you're exhausted
3/28/19, 11:24 AM - Hannah Guedenet: i have a meeting with Ana at 3
3/28/19, 11:28 AM - Hannah Guedenet: i'm not looking forward to it because i'm in a bad place
3/28/19, 11:55 AM - Charles G: Getting dinner now and got a couple bottles of tunisien wine to bring back with me
3/28/19, 11:57 AM - Charles G: Nothing on benin yet. I proposed going a few days earlier the week before for the ToT ( which would suck  but better than Easter weekend). I also proposed going after Easter weekend as a better alternative
3/28/19, 11:58 AM - Charles G: I also suggested she work with consultant or have local partner take lead in m&e. I'm for dreading and have anxious to read her response
3/28/19, 11:59 AM - Charles G: Half dreading, half wanting to read. Sorry for typos
3/28/19, 12:00 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Keep me posted. I'm sorry hun
3/28/19, 12:00 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Going into meeting with Ana...
3/28/19, 12:36 PM - Charles G: thanks for clarifying. I thought the cocktail was $245
3/28/19, 12:36 PM - Charles G: oops, I mean $25
3/28/19, 12:36 PM - Charles G: let me know how the meeting goes
3/28/19, 1:36 PM - Hannah Guedenet: It went meh. I'll send a voice recording or video with my thoughts.
3/28/19, 2:04 PM - Charles G: ok...
3/28/19, 3:03 PM - Hannah Guedenet: How was the response from Vajitha?
3/28/19, 3:03 PM - Hannah Guedenet: (not sure if you're still up)
3/28/19, 3:08 PM - Hannah Guedenet: <Media omitted>
3/28/19, 3:15 PM - Charles G: I'm up but need to brush my teeth and get some sleep. Thanks for the voice message. Were you on the metro?
3/28/19, 3:15 PM - Charles G: Our jobs right now are just insane
3/28/19, 3:17 PM - Charles G: and it's going to stay this way for the next 3+ weeks if I go to Benin.  We need to find ways to cope. I have found myself coping by dreaming about other jobs but it's not really helping. It just makes me dislike and feel more disconnected to my actual current work.
3/28/19, 3:18 PM - Charles G: I did some journaling this evening and that helped a little. It made me feel a little less overwhelmed to write down a lot of things that were bouncing around in my head
3/28/19, 3:18 PM - Charles G: ok, going to get ready for bed. I'll send a voice message
3/28/19, 3:25 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Love you babe
3/28/19, 3:27 PM - Hannah Guedenet: I know what would help. Just don't go to Benin
3/28/19, 3:31 PM - Charles G: <Media omitted>
3/28/19, 3:32 PM - Charles G: Sorry, just sent a rambling and somewhat incoherent message
3/28/19, 3:33 PM - Charles G: Love you. Give the girls kisses. I hope they liked the message from last night
3/28/19, 7:12 PM - Hannah Guedenet: <Media omitted>
3/29/19, 4:43 AM - Hannah Guedenet: <Media omitted>
3/29/19, 6:02 AM - Hannah Guedenet: question - did you volunteer to help with the challenge group on sunday?
3/29/19, 6:02 AM - Hannah Guedenet: i was thinking it would be nice to skip church and have family time. maybe go for a short hike or something
3/29/19, 7:25 AM - Hannah Guedenet: applicable article from HBR: https://hbr.org/2019/03/how-to-help-your-team-with-burnout-when-youre-burned-out-yourself?utm_medium=email&utm_source=newsletter_daily&utm_campaign=mtod_not_activesubs&referral=00203&deliveryName=DM32272
3/29/19, 7:25 AM - Hannah Guedenet: so i got an HBR subscription - i like their stuff and want to grow my mgmt skills
3/29/19, 7:25 AM - Hannah Guedenet: i sent you the password
3/29/19, 9:01 AM - Charles G: hey there!
3/29/19, 9:01 AM - Charles G: I told Jennifer that I I might but I'm totally fine not going
3/29/19, 9:02 AM - Charles G: let's skip church! family time is good
3/29/19, 9:02 AM - Charles G: I was hoping you would get a subscription. I like their stuff
3/29/19, 9:03 AM - Hannah Guedenet: 👍🏻
3/29/19, 9:04 AM - Hannah Guedenet: you're getting home close to midnight...you're going to be exhausted
3/29/19, 9:04 AM - Hannah Guedenet: i mean your flight lands at 9:15 or something but then you still have to get home
3/29/19, 9:06 AM - Charles G: I'm flying business class at least :)
3/29/19, 9:11 AM - Hannah Guedenet: oh yeah - forgot that. so lucky
3/29/19, 9:11 AM - Hannah Guedenet: how was your day?
3/29/19, 9:36 AM - Charles G: Exhausting. I'm worried that we didn't get to cover everything
3/29/19, 9:48 AM - Charles G: So much prep work for a training of trainers. Learning a lot in the process
3/29/19, 9:48 AM - Charles G: How are the girls? They bring good listeners?
3/29/19, 10:13 AM - Hannah Guedenet: ohhh - it took me a minute to figure out what bring good listeners meanT
3/29/19, 10:13 AM - Hannah Guedenet: you mean being
3/29/19, 10:13 AM - Hannah Guedenet: girls have been stellar
3/29/19, 10:13 AM - Hannah Guedenet: they are the highlight of life for me right now with how much work sucks
3/29/19, 10:39 AM - Charles G: Good! I know what you mean about the girls
3/29/19, 10:39 AM - Charles G: I'm back at the shopping place. Buying presents
3/29/19, 10:40 AM - Hannah Guedenet: more stuff?
3/29/19, 10:42 AM - Hannah Guedenet: i  keep meaning to ask - did angel ever get back to you on the bathroom?
3/29/19, 12:23 PM - Charles G: I got some nice presents but spent less than $30. I have not spent more than my my M&IE.
3/29/19, 12:24 PM - Hannah Guedenet: i wasn't worried
3/29/19, 12:24 PM - Charles G: Fyi, took out a lot of money but most of it is for the hotel + money I lent to someone
3/29/19, 12:25 PM - Charles G: I'm just really impressed myself. Got a ton of good stuff for so little money
3/29/19, 12:25 PM - Hannah Guedenet: i saw
3/29/19, 12:25 PM - Hannah Guedenet: we have money for now
3/29/19, 12:25 PM - Hannah Guedenet: hope you do your expense report quickly though
3/29/19, 12:25 PM - Charles G: Angel did text to say he had lost my email address. I need to follow up with him
3/29/19, 12:26 PM - Charles G: Yes
3/29/19, 12:26 PM - Hannah Guedenet: ok
3/29/19, 12:26 PM - Hannah Guedenet: and yes pelase
3/29/19, 2:35 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Any update on Benin?
3/29/19, 3:27 PM - Hannah Guedenet: You alive?
3/29/19, 3:40 PM - Charles G: Hey
3/29/19, 3:41 PM - Charles G: Just got home. It was nice not to work in the evening for once
3/29/19, 3:41 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Nice!!!
3/29/19, 3:41 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Making pizza on the grill!!
3/29/19, 3:42 PM - Charles G: Nothing on benin yet but not sure email is updating.
3/29/19, 3:42 PM - Charles G: Oh man, I miss your pizza
3/29/19, 3:47 PM - Hannah Guedenet: I miss you
3/29/19, 3:50 PM - Charles G: I miss you. This delayed response from Vijitha gives me hope that maybe I won't need to go. I so just want to stay with my family. Miss you so much
3/29/19, 3:56 PM - Hannah Guedenet: I really hope so. And it's ok if you don't miss the craziness at home
3/29/19, 4:12 PM - Charles G: it's been crazy here. I prefer the craziness of home over the craziness of work
3/29/19, 4:19 PM - Charles G: so, Vijitha responded but it's not clear when she thinks I should travel.
3/29/19, 4:20 PM - Charles G: She said it would be nice if I could travel on April 9th and stay through the camp the week of the 15th but then says I would need time to prepare the training materials and they would need to be reviewed by the GBV expert.
3/29/19, 4:22 PM - Hannah Guedenet: So when will you have time to do that??
3/29/19, 4:23 PM - Charles G: she seems to be suggesting (or I'm interpreting email as saying) that it's not realistic for me to go out there so early. There's no way I can prepare a training, have someone send feedback, and incorporate that feedback in basically a week
3/29/19, 4:27 PM - Charles G: she also doesn't directly answer the question of what I'm responsible for
3/29/19, 4:27 PM - Charles G: except to say that we need to provide support to local partners.
3/29/19, 4:28 PM - Charles G: Anyways, not a super helpful email but also not a bad one either. I will again push that I leave after Easter weekend
3/29/19, 4:28 PM - Charles G: ok, going to bed now. love you!!!!!!!!!
3/29/19, 4:31 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Love you! Safe travels tomorrow!
3/30/19, 3:58 AM - Charles G: At the airport. Coming home!!
3/30/19, 3:59 AM - Charles G: Angel got back to me. Can we have him come on Wednesday? Is there any time that works for you?
3/30/19, 5:08 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Yeah. I'm around on Wednesday. The cleaning folks are supposed to come...might see if they could come another day
3/30/19, 5:16 AM - Hannah Guedenet: You missed a good basketball game last night.
3/30/19, 7:40 AM - Charles G: Bummer. But MSU is still in, right?
3/30/19, 7:40 AM - Charles G: Im in Germany
3/30/19, 7:45 AM - Hannah Guedenet: How was business class??
3/30/19, 7:46 AM - Hannah Guedenet: And yes they're still in. They'll play Duke tomorrow night. It'll be a good game
3/30/19, 7:46 AM - Hannah Guedenet: We're going on bike ride to park. Have picnic
3/30/19, 8:05 AM - Charles G: It was a small plane but still very nice. I'll in first class for my flight to DC 😀😀
3/30/19, 8:06 AM - Charles G: Nice! Send me a picture if you have a chance
3/30/19, 8:20 AM - Charles G: <Media omitted>
3/30/19, 8:26 AM - Charles G: First class is super comfy but nearly as fancy as other business class I've seen. Not complaining though!!
3/30/19, 8:27 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Enjoy
3/30/19, 8:27 AM - Hannah Guedenet: <Media omitted>
3/30/19, 8:27 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Addie says it's a warm day
3/30/19, 8:28 AM - Hannah Guedenet: <Media omitted>
3/30/19, 8:32 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Oh and Addie slept in undies last night!!!
3/30/19, 8:34 AM - Charles G: So cute. I love Addie's haircut
3/30/19, 8:35 AM - Charles G: Is it actually really warm or is it just Addie?
3/30/19, 8:43 AM - Charles G: Ok. We're going to lift off soon. Love you!!!
3/30/19, 8:45 AM - Charles G: Wish I could be at the park with you all. Looks lovely. I will be working must of my flight...but in comfort at least. I will take a comp day eventually
3/30/19, 8:53 AM - Hannah Guedenet: <Media omitted>
3/30/19, 8:54 AM - Hannah Guedenet: And when will you take comp time
3/30/19, 8:58 AM - Charles G: You look really cute too
3/30/19, 8:59 AM - Charles G: I don't know. Not this week but maybe the week after. I don't think I'll go to benin until after Easter
3/30/19, 9:03 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Ahhh thabjs
3/30/19, 9:04 AM - Hannah Guedenet: <Media omitted>

3/30/19, 6:15 PM - Charles G: Late night for the girls. Thanks for vid!!!!! 😊
3/30/19, 6:16 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Yeah Addie is definitely grumpy but they're in bed. And I'm hungry. I missed most of the food at the party
3/30/19, 6:38 PM - Charles G: Oh bummer
3/30/19, 6:39 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Eating a quesadilla
3/30/19, 6:39 PM - Hannah Guedenet: You in a cab???
3/30/19, 6:42 PM - Charles G: No, got stick in the worst line at customs. Just got through. Getting bag now
3/30/19, 6:43 PM - Hannah Guedenet: GLOBAL ENTRY
3/30/19, 6:43 PM - Hannah Guedenet: 🙄
3/30/19, 6:53 PM - Charles G: I'm in the taxi
3/30/19, 6:53 PM - Charles G: Phone is almost dead
3/30/19, 6:53 PM - Charles G: They don't do mobile passport anymore. I'm very annoyed
3/30/19, 6:53 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Woohoo
3/30/19, 6:54 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Oh I didn't realize that changed
3/30/19, 6:54 PM - Charles G: Yep. Road is all clear. Moving fast
3/30/19, 6:54 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Cool
3/30/19, 6:54 PM - Hannah Guedenet: You tired? I am...
3/30/19, 6:57 PM - Charles G: Yes, exhausted. Just want to shower and crawl into bed
3/30/19, 6:59 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Ok
3/31/19, 7:41 AM - Hannah Guedenet: <Media omitted>
3/31/19, 1:30 PM - Charles G: Decided to go to park near Elise house
3/31/19, 1:30 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Ok
4/2/19, 8:59 AM - Hannah Guedenet: hey
4/2/19, 8:59 AM - Hannah Guedenet: could yuo switch drop off and pick up on thursday?
4/2/19, 12:09 PM - Charles G: Yes
4/2/19, 3:20 PM - Charles G: I'm on the 16
4/3/19, 5:40 AM - Charles G: <Media omitted>
4/3/19, 5:40 AM - Hannah Guedenet: oh yeah - she can never get down from there...
4/3/19, 5:41 AM - Hannah Guedenet: it's obnoxious
4/3/19, 7:46 AM - Hannah Guedenet: so babe, i had 2 questions I asked you to ask Angel...
4/3/19, 7:46 AM - Hannah Guedenet: he just showed up - all he wanted to do today was have me sign the quote
4/3/19, 7:46 AM - Hannah Guedenet: he is not starting work - he wants to start tomorrow
4/3/19, 7:46 AM - Hannah Guedenet: and the work will take 3-4 days
4/3/19, 7:46 AM - Hannah Guedenet: and we need to buy the tiles
4/3/19, 7:47 AM - Hannah Guedenet: so 1) i wish you had called him and talked through my two questions
4/3/19, 7:47 AM - Hannah Guedenet: 2) we need to plan to be home for the next few days
4/3/19, 7:47 AM - Hannah Guedenet: i told him he could start on friday since neither of us can be home
4/3/19, 7:47 AM - Hannah Guedenet: so lesson learned - don't make assumptions. ask questions and get all the information so we can plan accordingly
4/3/19, 7:47 AM - Hannah Guedenet: i am frustrated right now
4/3/19, 7:48 AM - Hannah Guedenet: the cleaners could have come and at least most of the house would have been clean
4/3/19, 8:08 AM - Charles G: That is frustrating. I'm not sure where the miscommunication happened. I asked him when he was going to start work, not when he would come bring us the quote.
4/3/19, 8:09 AM - Hannah Guedenet: you asked in a text
4/3/19, 8:09 AM - Hannah Guedenet: and you didn't ask how long the work would take
4/3/19, 8:09 AM - Hannah Guedenet: neither of us could stay home tomorrow
4/3/19, 8:10 AM - Charles G: If the cleaners had come, the house would only have been clean a couple days before he started work. It's better that they wait until next week
4/3/19, 8:11 AM - Hannah Guedenet: ok
4/3/19, 8:11 AM - Hannah Guedenet: in other news - i would like to get that air mattress for camping
4/3/19, 8:12 AM - Hannah Guedenet: it will cost $250 when using the 20% off and the $50 rebate i got from my contacts
4/3/19, 8:12 AM - Hannah Guedenet: it can be my birthday present
4/3/19, 8:19 AM - Hannah Guedenet: also - now that you are not going to benin, are we going to MExico?
4/3/19, 8:31 AM - Charles G: OK on the air mattress.. We may need a minivan just so we can fit all our camping stuff
4/3/19, 8:31 AM - Hannah Guedenet: we need a minivan for many reasons
4/3/19, 8:31 AM - Hannah Guedenet: and mexico
4/3/19, 8:32 AM - Hannah Guedenet: ??
4/3/19, 8:32 AM - Charles G: I guess we can do it now! Right?
4/3/19, 8:32 AM - Charles G: it's going to be a little less crazy for us and the girls now that I'm not traveling for 10+ days
4/3/19, 8:32 AM - Hannah Guedenet: i mean i still have to go to seattle, but i'm taking a red-eye flight and will land early Friday morning
4/3/19, 8:33 AM - Hannah Guedenet: so i'll be here for Friday night pizza
4/3/19, 8:33 AM - Hannah Guedenet: i agree
4/3/19, 8:33 AM - Charles G: cool. don't want to miss that
4/3/19, 8:33 AM - Hannah Guedenet: also just got off the phone with sam the blind guy
4/3/19, 8:34 AM - Hannah Guedenet: we're going to have to take the shade down and take it to their shop - it will have to be sent back to be repaired - and will cost $35
4/3/19, 8:34 AM - Hannah Guedenet: i'm trying to figure out how we take it down
4/3/19, 8:35 AM - Charles G: where's their shop?
4/3/19, 8:35 AM - Hannah Guedenet: silver spring
4/3/19, 8:35 AM - Charles G: will they re-install it or do we have to?
4/3/19, 8:36 AM - Hannah Guedenet: it's just putting it back in the holder - it is supposed to be easy but i didn't understand his instructions at all
4/3/19, 8:36 AM - Hannah Guedenet: it's up by church and he's often there on sundays he said
4/3/19, 8:36 AM - Hannah Guedenet: by chick fil a
4/3/19, 8:41 AM - Charles G: ok, cool
4/3/19, 8:41 AM - Charles G: i can look at it tonight
4/3/19, 8:42 AM - Hannah Guedenet: k thanks
4/3/19, 9:05 AM - Hannah Guedenet: i figured it out
4/3/19, 9:06 AM - Hannah Guedenet: we'll need to do it together though - with a ladder
4/3/19, 9:18 AM - Charles G: ok
4/3/19, 2:52 PM - Charles G: Walking to school now
4/3/19, 2:57 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Ok cool
4/3/19, 2:57 PM - Hannah Guedenet: We're going to walk to library in a few. Could you take the car and meet us there? Bring in the books and CDs
4/4/19, 4:38 PM - Hannah Guedenet: I'm waiting for Dee and family show up at a gelato place. Just going to say a quick hello then hopefully head home. Not sure if I'll make it home in time for bedtime
4/4/19, 4:38 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Also realizing I shouldn't have responded to your mom. I should have let you
4/4/19, 5:19 PM - Hannah Guedenet: On red line
4/4/19, 5:19 PM - Hannah Guedenet: I'll give girls kisses as soon as I get there
4/4/19, 5:46 PM - Charles G: Ok. They're in bed.
4/4/19, 5:47 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Getting in Lyft at Takoma. No buses
4/4/19, 5:48 PM - Hannah Guedenet: When is aubin coming over
4/5/19, 8:41 AM - Hannah Guedenet: I am frozen. I have heat in full blast in car. My hands are ice blocks
4/5/19, 8:50 AM - Charles G: Good luck today!! You're gonna kill it
4/5/19, 8:51 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Thanks. I'm sure looking very nice will help
4/5/19, 8:52 AM - Charles G: Huh?
4/5/19, 8:52 AM - Charles G: Oh, got it
4/5/19, 8:52 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Oh wait. It was that I look really nice
4/5/19, 8:52 AM - Charles G: You're funny
4/5/19, 8:52 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Not very
4/5/19, 8:52 AM - Hannah Guedenet: You're a 💩
4/5/19, 11:13 AM - Hannah Guedenet: It sucked. I was so nervous
4/5/19, 12:01 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Headed home.
4/5/19, 12:14 PM - Hannah Guedenet: I can get the Cointreau and beer on my way home if you want
4/5/19, 2:17 PM - Charles G: I should have called you about talking to the girls. Hannah just sent my call to VM and never acknowledged my message.
4/5/19, 2:17 PM - Charles G: that's from Malia. Can I tell her you've blocked her?
4/5/19, 2:17 PM - Charles G: I'm happy to
4/5/19, 2:21 PM - Hannah Guedenet: No I will send her an email
4/6/19, 10:41 AM - Charles G: Can u ask about the tiles?
4/6/19, 10:45 AM - Hannah Guedenet: Yes
4/6/19, 10:46 AM - Hannah Guedenet: I talked to Malia
4/6/19, 10:47 AM - Hannah Guedenet: 25 12x12

4/30/19, 2:40 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Oh man well the first one is good
4/30/19, 2:40 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Dinner marvel comic minutes???
4/30/19, 2:41 PM - Charles G: Sorry. Download marvel movies to watch in cabo
4/30/19, 2:56 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Ahhh
4/30/19, 2:57 PM - Hannah Guedenet: I totally forgot that Carrie from peace corps is in Seattle
4/30/19, 3:15 PM - Charles G: Cool. Me too. You going to meet her?
4/30/19, 4:32 PM - Hannah Guedenet: I don't know when I would. Seth had to cancel happy hour. Anna was having complications with her pregnancy and went to the hospital. The baby is not due until June
4/30/19, 4:32 PM - Hannah Guedenet: How was your day?
4/30/19, 4:54 PM - Charles G: That's scary. I hope she's ok.
4/30/19, 4:54 PM - Charles G: Pretty good day but pretty much back to back meetings
4/30/19, 4:54 PM - Charles G: How about you?
4/30/19, 5:04 PM - Charles G: By the way, did Malia give us access to Hulu again?
4/30/19, 5:14 PM - Hannah Guedenet: No the mchans did but it's not live TV
4/30/19, 6:06 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Missed video call
4/30/19, 6:07 PM - Hannah Guedenet: <Media omitted>
4/30/19, 6:22 PM - Hannah Guedenet: What in the world?
4/30/19, 6:22 PM - Hannah Guedenet: <Media omitted>
4/30/19, 6:53 PM - Charles G: Shoot. Didn't think about how you would still get my message. Sorry. I didn't want you to have to indirectly desk with more Malia texts
4/30/19, 6:54 PM - Charles G: Desk=deal
4/30/19, 6:55 PM - Charles G: She messaged about Hulu. She thinks you got her message with the password and that we're using it a lot.
4/30/19, 7:00 PM - Charles G: <Media omitted>
4/30/19, 7:38 PM - Hannah Guedenet: Oh good heavens.
4/30/19, 7:39 PM - Hannah Guedenet: And wow! You don't mince words! Did she respond to your message about being manipulative??
4/30/19, 7:42 PM - Charles G: she responded with angry text about me not being compassionate. I responded just to her saying that if she feels lonely, isolated, and depressed, to say that. I can empathize with that. I really can. But making others feel bad about themselves won't make me feel compassion
4/30/19, 7:43 PM - Hannah Guedenet: damn babe
4/30/19, 7:43 PM - Hannah Guedenet: i'm really impressed
4/30/19, 7:44 PM - Hannah Guedenet: i'm sorry you are having to deal with it though
4/30/19, 7:44 PM - Hannah Guedenet: i have tried to protect you from it
4/30/19, 7:44 PM - Charles G: it's ok. I'm listening to Taize music on Spotify. It's so calming. Gosh I love that place.
4/30/19, 7:45 PM - Hannah Guedenet: i want to go there
4/30/19, 7:46 PM - Charles G: so do you think the Mchans gave us Malia's password by accident? She said we used 40 hours of hulu to watch madam secretary, fancy nancy, Inside North Korea, the Good Place, The Mindy Project, and Fixer Upper. Or maybe somebody hacked into her account?
4/30/19, 7:53 PM - Hannah Guedenet: that was months ago
4/30/19, 7:53 PM - Hannah Guedenet: i never watched the mindy project though
4/30/19, 7:53 PM - Hannah Guedenet: is that problem?
4/30/19, 7:54 PM - Hannah Guedenet: like is she charged mroe b/c we watched stuff?
4/30/19, 7:54 PM - Hannah Guedenet: and i never watched inside north korea
4/30/19, 7:54 PM - Hannah Guedenet: i have no idea
4/30/19, 7:55 PM - Charles G: did you watch it before Malia closed off access? She apparently sent you the password recently and thinks you saw it and have been using it. She says 40 of 50 hours was used by us and wants us to split cost with her.
4/30/19, 8:00 PM - Hannah Guedenet: i did not receive the password
4/30/19, 8:00 PM - Hannah Guedenet: we have not used it since january
4/30/19, 8:00 PM - Charles G: ok. I'll relay the message.
4/30/19, 8:01 PM - Charles G: I don't mind
4/30/19, 8:01 PM - Charles G: how's the hotel?
4/30/19, 8:01 PM - Hannah Guedenet: you can ask how much time on netflix she has used...
4/30/19, 8:01 PM - Hannah Guedenet: she uses our password and has an accoung
4/30/19, 8:01 PM - Hannah Guedenet: she's being such a pissant
4/30/19, 8:01 PM - Hannah Guedenet: hotel is nice
4/30/19, 8:01 PM - Hannah Guedenet: still working...
4/30/19, 8:01 PM - Charles G: did you finish the report?
4/30/19, 8:01 PM - Hannah Guedenet: almost
4/30/19, 8:09 PM - Charles G: how much do I pay cleaning folks again?

4/30/19, 8:15 PM - Hannah Guedenet: i'll just send her a check for $50 when we're home
4/30/19, 8:15 PM - Hannah Guedenet: for hulu
4/30/19, 8:20 PM - Charles G: I can deal with it. Also, I can't text with her about other things and pretend like she's not treating you and others like crap.
4/30/19, 8:28 PM - Hannah Guedenet: You should go to bed babe
4/30/19, 8:30 PM - Charles G: yeah, I should.
4/30/19, 8:30 PM - Hannah Guedenet: What did you text back about Hulu? Are you done communicating with her?
4/30/19, 8:47 PM - Hannah Guedenet: I love you
4/30/19, 9:07 PM - Charles G: I relayed what you said about not using it since January.
4/30/19, 9:08 PM - Charles G: You can send her check when you get back. I didn't tell her that. She would probably take it the wrong way, somehow
4/30/19, 9:08 PM - Charles G: no response from her. I'm going to bed
4/30/19, 9:08 PM - Charles G: love you!!
